{:toc}

Name: Sniper titan(Tone titan) 

Size: Titan

Health type: Medium Titan Health(4 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Sniper titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Sniper titans use the 40mm tracker cannon, tracking rockets, sonar pulse and particle wall. It is believed that Sniper titans use the enhanced tracker rounds kit. 

## Movement/positions

When Sniper titans deploy on the map they walk over to predetermined static positions, these positions can be out of view to the harvester or in view of the harvester where they focus harvester if that’s the case. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Sniper titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Sniper titans are heavy hitting high damaging titans that must be dealt quickly if they will focus the harvester. Sniper titans will focus on sniping pilots in view such as from ejection. Sniper titans will destroy harvesters very quickly. Sniper titans are a very high priority if the harvester is in line of sight, if not they can be dealt with last. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Sniper titans will go in predetermined locations where they stand still, when spotting enemies they will use their tracker cannon, if it’s a Titan they will use tracking rockets as soon as a full lockon has been established. Sonar pulse will be used when off cooldown to mark militia forces. When the Sniper titan receives damage they deploy a particle wall. Some Sniper titans will be in static positions in view of the harvester making them a direct threat to the harvester while some stay in the back acting like sentry’s. Sniper titans will prioritize militia forces if they are in view while enroute to harvester or out of view of the harvester, if firing on the harvester they will ignore nearby enemies unless attacked. 

## Strengths

Sniper titans can snipe pilots in close to mid and even long distance. Sniper titans deal extreme amounts of burst damage against exposed titans. Sniper titans deal huge amounts of damage to harvesters with their tracking rockets. Sonar pulse will put partial lock ons on militia titans increasing the chance of lockons therefore producing tracking rockets to deal huge amounts of damage. Sniper Titans can punish any close quarters and militia titans that try to roam. Sniper titans do well against Monarch, Legions(if flanking) and Northstars. Sniper titans serve as a specialized way to snipe militia forces and harvesters, this forces pilots and titans to go behind cover more. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Sniper titans have many weaknesses, that being said they are not to be underestimated. When dealing with Sniper titans as a pilot make sure to show as little flesh as possible and keep moving, the tracker cannon can be accurate in mid to short range so long range engagements are more recommended. Particle wall is their only way of defense so bait it out with attacks then don’t attack when the particle wall is up to force a quicker particle wall depletion. Sniper titans that focus on harvester can be easier to rodeo since they tend to focus on the harvester, other than that they are pretty easy to destroy as a pilot, A-wall and holo pilot can help by blocking and drawing tracker cannon attacks.

For titans you must respect the tracker rockets that Sniper titans launch since they deal huge burst damage, thankfully that’s the only real problem that Sniper titans have, to counter tracking rockets avoid getting hit with tracker cannon with defensive abilities and use dash. Electric smoke can also remove lock ons preventing damage ultimately, be mindful that tracking rockets in the air already will not be affected by electric smoke, you must dash into cover instead. When attacking Sniper titans they will deploy a particle wall, most of the time you can destroy it or you can wait it out, just don’t expose yourself so you can avoid tracking rockets. Sonar pulse is impossible to avoid unless it’s eaten by thermal shield and vortex shield. Sniper titans are vulnerable with flanking and close quarters combat, be warned that close quarters combat can give them the ability to get lock ons so keep that in mind when engaging, use defensive abilities, electric smoke and dash to counter. Titans that can deal with Sniper titans well are Tone, Northstar, Ronin, Ion and Scorch. If you try to get terminations on Sniper titans you should be very careful as you can get punished heavily for that, instead it will be better to play it safe and destroy them from a distance. Sniper titans aren’t that dangerous once the tracking rockets are dealt with making them easy cannon fodder.
