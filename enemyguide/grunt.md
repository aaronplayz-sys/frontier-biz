Name: Grunt

Size: Small

Health type: Low Infantry Health

## Method of deployment

Grunts are deployed by drop pods and drop ships. Grunts deploy on the battlefield in squads of 4 grunts. 

## Arsenal

Various conventional bullet firearms such as flatline, r-201, volt. Grunts will carry the charge rifle. Grunts will throw frag grenades as their ordnance. If enemy pilots get close they will melee. 

## Movement/positions

Grunts will run in predetermined paths to harvester when not engaged in combat, they will typically clump up near the harvester and fire upon it. Some maps will have grunts camp at a distance and will fire on the harvester with charge rifles.

## Difficulty level buffs

On hard they gain access to the charge rifle, they will use it to attack harvesters; on hard it is unclear when they will use it over primary weapons against militia titans. 

On master one member of the squad will have a deployable shield that deflects rounds and will slowly damage and stun pilots caught inside. Grunts will always use charge rifles against militia titans and harvesters if in line of sight. Weapon accuracy is heavily increased.

## Threat level and priority 

Grunts will easily kill incompetent pilots if they don’t move or get too close. Kill grunts before they reach the harvester as they don’t pose as much of a threat but will need to be killed before damaging the harvester.

## Behavior

Grunts will immediately run towards the harvester once spawned on the map, they will fire upon any visible enemy. Grunts will always stay together in the 4 man squad and will do call outs. Grunts travel in predictable paths. Grunts will use their charge rifles upon seeing an enemy Titan or harvester. Grunts will sometimes throw frag grenades. If pilots get too close the grunts will try to melee them. 

## Strengths

Grunts don’t have too many strengths but can often be a distraction for bigger threats. Grunts on harder difficulties will damage titans if defensive and evasive measures aren’t taken. Grunts can deplete harvester shields fast on master and insane and if in big enough groups, will destroy harvester much faster than expected.

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Grunts by themselves die very easily by pretty much every method of weaponry. All pilot ordnance and weaponry kill grunts instantly or with a few bullets. Headshots on grunts do even more damage so aim for those if able. For titans they should melee or use primary fire to dispatch grunts. Since grunts gain the charge rifle on harder difficulties do not underestimate the amount of damage their charge rifles can do. Luckily they can’t track targets well so dashing to the side helps.
