Name: Stalker

Size: Small

Health type: High Infantry Health

## Method of deployment

Stalkers are deployed by drop pods in squads of 4. 

## Arsenal

All Stalkers will be equipped with the EPG launcher, stalkers will use their power supply as a bomb against harvester. Stalker power supply detonates when damaged from behind or in the front with firearms. Stalkers will heavily damage titans if stepped on. Stalker explosions bypass Titan defensive abilities like particle wall or vortex shield. 

## Movement/positions

Stalkers after being deployed will walk in predictable paths to the harvester, stalkers will sprint towards harvester when close to it. Stalkers will sprint towards the harvester at any distance if damaged but only if they are not severely damaged. Once at the harvester they self detonate power supply’s. Stalkers will not chase enemies. 

## Difficulty level buffs

On hard stalkers gain the use of the epg launcher.

On master the EPG rockets will instantly kill pilots on direct hits and the projectile speed is increased. Accuracy is increased on harder difficulties. 

## Threat level and priority 

Stalkers on hard or above become one of the most dangerous enemies that pilots will face. Stalkers should be destroyed before reaching the harvester as they heavily damage it with their power supply’s. Titans have a much easier time destroying stalkers. 

## Behavior

One deployed stalkers will walk in predetermined paths to the harvester. Stalkers will fire upon enemies in line of sight if on hard or above difficulties. If stalkers are damaged they have the possibility to self-destruct. If they are slightly damaged they will begin to run to the harvester then explode momentarily while running. Stalkers will instantly detonate from being crushed by titans dealing heavy damage to the titan. If stalkers are damaged from behind the chance of self destruction is pretty much guaranteed. Stalkers will not chase enemies and prioritize destroying the harvester. 

## Strengths

Stalkers have many strengths, they have heavy armour, can run very fast, they can self destruct and can be unpredictable, they deal heavy damage when stepped on and are immune to pilot executions. When they possess the EPG launcher allowing them to “snipe” pilots from a distance or close up. Since their accuracy is increased on harder difficulties they rarely miss and will lead shots. Stalkers can also hear pilots so they can prefire around corners. Stalkers can wipe out squads of pilots in seconds if given the chance. Stalkers will require lots of bullets to destroy and will survive one use of ordinance. Stalkers are pretty much the most dangerous infantry pilots will have to face. Stalkers serve as the frontline heavy assault infantry for the IMC. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Stalkers are very dangerous to pilots but are pretty weak against Titans. Pilots must respect stalkers as they can die very quickly to them. Ordnance and tactical use is a must when dealing with stalkers, grenade launchers and light machine guns help considerably when dealing with maps with lots of stalkers. Stalker detonations must be kept in mind when battling stalker groups as the power supply explosions can kill pilots if they are close enough therefore pilots must utilize range, parkour and use of abilities to prevent deaths. Melee can kill stalkers but that is heavily discouraged. Stalkers do have a weakness and that’s its power supply in its back, the power supply is vulnerable and can be targeted causing stalkers to self-destruct after a few bullets are fired upon it. Flanking and quick peeking are recommended when dealing with stalkers as stalkers are very accurate, due to their accuracy pilots must avoid showing any part of the pilots body as stalkers will punish any exposed body parts. Stalkers will run when they are damaged making the window of preventing them from damaging the harvester nearly impossible. So pilots should destroy the stalkers before that can happen, gravity star can help considerably against stalkers making them clumped up, perfect for close calls near harvester and it is a perfect combo with grenade launchers.

Some weapons and abilities do prevent stalkers from self-destructing and those are the electric smoke grenade(electric smoke as well), thermite star(any thermite) and 2 satchels. Sniping can be a good option if you don’t wish to be close to stalkers, equipping double take or dmr are good options for dealing with stalkers from a distance. Tacticals like A-wall, stim, holo pilot, and cloak can help a lot, A-wall can block epg projectiles and will amp weapons, the stim and cloak can be used for evasion and holo pilot will bait out epg attacks. For titans stalkers aren’t that dangerous, electric smoke and melee can dispatch them very quickly, use aoe abilities if needed. Stalkers will use EPG on titans but the damage is minimal, never step on stalkers as this will deal heavy damage to your titans chassis. Keep in mind that stalker power supply explosions will bypass defensive abilities. Arc traps are incredibly useful against stalkers as arc traps will temporality power them off, it is possible to stun lock them if enough arc traps are placed. Even with all of the preparation the stalkers can still kill pilots, it’s just a matter of when not if.
