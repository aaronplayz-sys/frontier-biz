Name: Legion

Size: Titan

Health type: High Titan Health(5 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Legion titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Legion titans use the predator cannon, power shot, gun shield and mode switch. It is believed that Legion titans use enhanced ammo capacity. 

## Movement/positions

When deployed on the map they will go in predictable paths to the harvester. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Legion titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Legion titans are one of the weaker titans that the militia will face, they don't dish out a lot of damage to pilots or titans unless given enough time to fire. Legion titans aren’t a priority unless nearing harvesters. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Legion titans will go towards the harvester in predetermined paths, any nearby enemies in line of sight will be fired upon with predator cannon, power shot will be used on pilots or titans in view, typically Legion titans will only use close range mode. When Legion titans take damage they will deploy a gun shield and return fire. 

## Strengths

Legion titans are bullet sponges for the IMC forces, they don’t do a lot of damage but can still lay down heavy consistent fire on militia titans, close range power shot can kill damaged pilots instantly. Gun shields make them harder to kill as most battles are face to face. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Legion titans aren’t a major threat to militia operations, they only have 2 attacks and move slowly making them easy targets, the only danger is that they can absorb ton of damage possibly distracting militia forces from more dangerous units, for pilots make sure not to move too slowly and avoid being in the crossfire as you can die from close range power shots, it requires 2 shots to kill pilots so keep that in mind. Legion titans are accurate but don’t move their chassis fast making them very easy to dodge their attacks, like always using high ground and movement mechanics makes Legion Titans easy to dispatch. For titans all defensive abilities and electric smokes pretty much make the Legion titans useless, abuse the fact that Legion weak point vulnerabilities are big so always aim for those. Legion titans will damage your Titan if it’s exposed long enough so always use cover when fighting them. Legion titans are very susceptible to static or area of effect abilities like thermite. Elevated and flanking positions against Legions is a guaranteed win as Legions can’t defend all sides at once. Arc traps counter Legion titans even further since they can instantly deplete an active gun shield. Legion titans are basically core meter/sword core feed. Remember to avoid the powershot and you will do fine against Legion titans.
