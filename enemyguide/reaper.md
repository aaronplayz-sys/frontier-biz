Name: Reaper

Size: Reaper(Medium)

Health type: Reaper Health

## Method of deployment

Reapers deploy on the map by warpfall.

## Arsenal

Reapers will attack enemies at a distance with reaper rockets, reaper rockets fire in predictable barrages, in close range combat they have a ground slam and a high damage melee. All reapers have the ability to launch tick units on the battlefield.

## Movement/positions

Reapers will move to the harvester in predictable paths, reapers are able to jump on roofs. Reapers will fire and stay stationary at nearby enemies in line of sight. Some reapers will move to predictable stationary positions and then act as turrets, these reapers will then spawn ticks indefinitely. Reapers will use an evasive dash to avoid danger, such as archer lockon. Ticks spawned from reapers will move to the harvester in predictable paths.

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, reapers gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties. No unique abilities are added.

## Threat level and priority 

Reapers deal a lot of damage to militia forces and harvesters so reapers must be destroyed promptly. The reapers that stay behind are those thst spawn ticks, they need to be focused as well, pilots should be very wary of the ticks and reaper rockets as they can die fast from them. Preferably one Titan or pilot should focus on reaper perches in appropriate maps. Reapers will heavily damage harvesters if it’s in line of sight so make sure that doesn’t happen. 

## Behavior

After proceeding to warp fall into the map, the reapers will proceed to stride towards predestined paths, that being a perch or towards the harvester. If a perched reaper dies, a running reaper will replace the previously destroyed perched reaper. Reapers will fire upon any enemies in sight and will use evasive tactics to avoid damage. Reapers will always use melee attacks if the opportunity presents itself. Perched reapers will stay spawning 4 ticks at a time. Perched reapers will fire long distance rockets at enemies' in line of sight. Reapers will also slam into pilots if the pilot is near the perch. Reapers tend to focus pilots more so than titans on harder difficulties if they are present. Reapers will sometimes go on top of buildings for height advantage and as a shortcut on some maps.

## Strengths

Reapers have many strengths, those being a decently good rocket attack that can shred a lot of Titan and harvester health in seconds. The reaper rockets will 2 shot pilots if they connect with pilots. In close range they can remove chunks of Titan health with each melee making them very deadly in close quarters. Reapers individually are easy to kill but it’s the combination and groups of reapers that attack at once that can overwhelm pilots and titans. Perched reapers can be extremely difficult for militia forces to deal with as they produce an onslaught of ticks, these ticks can kill pilots and chip Titan and harvester health over time. Perched reapers can also be too high for melee attacks or other close range attacks to hit them. Perched reapers are often farther back causing militia titans or pilots to roam into dangerous areas to dispatch them. Reapers have good armour making them immune to pilot melee attacks. Perched reaper ticks will chase any enemy in sight while enroute to the harvester. Lastly, the reaper warpfall can be deadly since the time it takes to react to the stealthy warpfall is cut short.

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Reapers being very tough and strong actually have some weaknesses, for pilots reaper rockets are slow making long distance battles always better for pilots. Reapers also have a big weak point vulnerability on their head and back making them easier to destroy. Anti Titan weapons dispatch reapers and reapers tend to clump up making aoe weapons excellent towards them. Reapers are also vulnerable to flanks. Pilots should be wary about reaper rockets as they can die to them fast, so pilots should use evasive and peeking if needed. Satchels are amazing for dealing with clumped up reapers, some good tacticals like holo pilot or a-wall like usual make reaper fights much easier. Overall make sure to parkour and avoid close range fights. As for the perched reaper spawned ticks, they travel in predictable paths so some memorization will help prevent death. Just remember that ticks chase you if you get close. Always go for longer range battles. As for titans, titans should be very cautious with the reaper melee as it will always heavily damage you, even through any defensive abilities. Luckily reapers can be stun locked easily by various attacks. Electric smoke can help with swarms of reapers making them confused and unable to attack enemies inside the smoke. Make sure to dash or use defensive abilities against reaper rockets or else the hull damage will be severe, defensive abilities and dash must be used, any aoe abilities should be used if there are swarms of reapers. Titans like Tone in particular are very good at dealing with reapers, Ronin can deal with them since his broadsword stun locks them and his arc wave aoe stuns. Scorch can provide plenty of aoe abilities making reapers easy to deal with.

Penetrating attacks and kits should be considered on reaper heavy maps. One Titan should focus on perched reapers so they don’t chip down on the militia titans' health. Arc traps are extremely useful for dealing with reapers and perched reapers as it can mass stun and animation cancel abilities like reaper rockets or tick spawning, therefore it is sometimes worth it to arc trap reaper perch locations to make the mission much easier. Overall reapers can be taken down fast by hitting weak point vulnerability with precision attacks, notably the laser shot does about 95 percent damage if hit directly on the back of the head. The Northstar can instantly kill reapers with a charged shot in the same spot. Overall make sure to aim for reapers weak point vulnerabilities and try not to invest too many abilities in destroying one if possible, of course that depends on the situation, avoid melee range and dash side to side against reaper rockets, don’t underestimate reapers and you should be fine.
