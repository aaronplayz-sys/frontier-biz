# Cloak Drone

{:toc}

Name: Cloaked Drone

Size: Small

Health type: High Infantry Health

## Method of deployment

Cloaked drones deploy on the battlefield by descending or a form of teleportation(unclear).

## Arsenal

Cloaked drones possess no weaponry, they instead provide cloak to friendly units underneath, the only units that cloaked drones can’t cloak are arc titans and ticks. Enemies inside cloaking fields will lose their symbol and mark on the map making them “invisible” even on the minimap.

## Movement/positions

Cloaked drones follow and provide support to various enemies on the battlefield. If the IMC unit dies while underneath the cloak drones cloaking field the cloaked drone will fly away to another nearby IMC unit. Cloaked drones have been seen to prioritize nuke titans and sniper titans but that depends on the mission. Cloaked drones will disappear if all combat IMC units have perished except on colony.

## Difficulty level buffs

It is unknown if cloaked drones get any buffs from harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Cloaked drones can often be very detrimental to frontier defense mission efforts if not destroyed fast. Cloaked drones themselves aren’t dangerous, it’s what they are providing support for that can be very dangerous. Therefore cloaked drones are a very high priority.

## Behavior

After descending on the map cloaked drones will make IMC units invisible, this invisibility functions exactly like the cloaking tactical pilot so pilots can see them better than titans. Cloak drones will find new assets if the previous IMC unit is dead. All IMC units can be cloaked except arc titans, plasma drones and ticks. Cloaked drones will only hover over one enemy at a time and will not stack on one single Titan (as an example), multiple units can be cloaked at the same time if they are clumped up.

## Strengths

Cloaked drones strength comes from hiding dangerous units such as nuke titans, that can cause missions to be lost and Titan deaths. Due to cloaked drones hiding enemy units they can provide flanks and surprise attacks against the militia forces. Another strength is that cloaked drones have high armour making them durable against many various firearms.

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Cloaked drones must be focused once deployed on the map, luckily they are very easy to spot. Cloaked drones aren’t as dangerous to pilots since pilots can see their cloaked units easier, generally pilots must mag dump or use anti Titan weapons like archer or mag launcher (because they are metallic) to kill cloaked drones easily. Other than that they are pretty simple to kill. As for titans the cloaked drones can die to precision attacks like northstar plasma bullet or laser shot, long range power shot can also destroy them, basically any high accurate attacks can dispatch them. Respect the cloaked drone and do not underestimate them or the cloaked units, you should be fine. Cloaked drones should be the first ones to be destroyed.
