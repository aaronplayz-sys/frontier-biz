{:toc}

Name: Mortar Titan (Tone is parent chassis)

Size: Titan

Health type: Low Titan Health(3 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Mortar titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Mortar titans use the Quad rocket, sonar pulse and particle wall. Mortar titans have a unique mortar attack that bombards the harvester at any range, they are kneeling still when firing mortars. 

## Movement/positions

When mortar titans deploy on the map they will move to predetermined static positions or stay in their dome shield. Once they are in the correct position they will begin laying mortar fire on the harvester. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, mortar titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Mortar titans are very weak threats against pilots and titans, on the other hand they are the biggest threat to the harvester in frontier defense. Roamers must prioritize their destruction and other militia forces must split across the map if necessary. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map, mortar titans will get into position and deploy their mortar bombardment, during mortar mortar bombardment they ignore any nearby enemies until damaged, once damaged or stunned they will exit mortar mode and engage any nearby foes, they do not move unless to melee nearby pilots or titans. Against distance threats they will use their quad rockets to shoot. As a defensive measure against attacks they will deploy their particle wall. Mortar titans will fire upon the harvester until destroyed. 

## Strengths

The mortar titans danger comes from the fact that they can destroy the harvester very quickly. Mortar titans force the militia forces to go out and roam causing huge distractions and force the rotation of defensive positions. Mortar titans can deploy particle walls to make it harder to destroy them. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Mortar titans themselves are incredibly weak titans that only are a danger to the harvester. Being low in health and lacking many abilities they are extremely easy to deal with as a pilot and Titan. Pilots and titans should make full use of the fact that mortar titans ignore any nearby enemies when bombarding, making them vulnerable to any attacks at any distance. Mortar Titan quad rocket will do damage if it lands but it is slow allowing defensive abilities and dash to counter it. Particle walls are easy to deal with by flanking and moving around it, or just walking through it. Due to how dangerous mortar titans are to the harvester, militia forces should place arc traps in their predetermined positions to stun them out of mortar ability. A cool trick with mortar titans is to attack them a little bit to activate their defensive stance so they don’t fire at harvesters. Don’t underestimate mortar melee attacks so don’t get too close but other than that mortar titans are easy to destroy, the hard part comes when mortar titans are way behind waves of IMC forces giving them plenty of time to attack the harvester, roaming titans like Ronin excel in mortar Titan hunting. Usually on maps with lots of mortar titans should encourage one pilot to be the roamer to focus on mortar titans. Over time mortar titans will be easier to deal with as you gain experience as to where they deploy, with this knowledge you can arc trap their locations to buy the team a huge amount of time, of course harvester shields can work well too as a last ditch effort to prevent harvester damage.
