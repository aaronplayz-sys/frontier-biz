{:toc}

Name: Tone

Size: Titan

Health type: Medium Titan Health(4 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Tone titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Tone titans use the 40mm tracker cannon, tracking rockets, sonar pulse and particle wall. It is believed that Tone titans use the enhanced tracker rounds kit. 

## Movement/positions

When Tone titans deploy on the map they run over to the harvester in predetermined paths and static positions very close to the harvester. On some maps tone titans will stay stationary in predetermined areas to shoot harvesters as they don’t like to get close. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Tone titans gain increased a.i, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Tone titans are heavy hitting high damaging titans that must be dealt with before they arrive at the harvester. Tone titans have moderate levels of aim against pilots. Tone titans will destroy harvesters very quickly. Tone titans have the same priority as the other titans, destroy when seen. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Tone titans will go in predetermined paths, when spotting enemies they will use their tracker cannon, if it’s a Titan they will use tracking rockets as soon as a lock-on has been established. Sonar pulse will be used when off cooldown to mark militia forces. When the Tone titan receives damage they deploy a particle wall. Some Tone titans will be in static positions facing harvester making them a direct threat to harvester. Tone titans will prioritize pilots in the air or near them.

## Strengths

Tone titans can snipe pilots in close to mid range combat, sometimes long distance. Tone titans deal extreme amounts of burst damage against exposed titans. Tone titans deal huge amounts of damage to harvesters. Sonar pulse will put partial lock ons on militia titans increasing the likelihood of tracking rockets. Tone Titans will punish any militia titans that try to roam. Tone titans do well against Monarch, Legions(if flanking) and Northstars. Tone titans serve as a way to keep militia forces behind cover and a way to deal damage from a distance. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Tone titans have many weaknesses, still they are not to be underestimated. When dealing with Tone titans as a pilot make sure to show as little flesh as possible and keep moving, the tracker cannon can be accurate in mid to short range so long range engagements are recommended. Particle wall is their only way of defense so bait it out with attacks then don’t attack when the particle wall is up to force a quicker particle wall depletion. Tone titans can be easier to rodeo since they tend to focus on other threats, other than that they are pretty easy to destroy as a pilot, A-wall and holo pilot can help by blocking and drawing tracker cannon attacks. For titans you must respect the tracker rockets that Tone titans launch since they deal huge burst damage, thankfully that’s the only real problem that Tone titans have, to counter tracking rockets avoid getting hit by the tracker cannon with defensive abilities and use dash. Electric smoke can also remove lock ons preventing damage, ultimately you must be mindful that tracking rockets in the air already will not be affected by electric smoke, you must dash into cover instead. When attacking Tone titans they will deploy a particle wall, most of the time you can destroy it or you can wait it out, just don’t expose yourself so you can avoid tracking rockets. Sonar pulse is impossible to avoid unless it’s eaten by thermal shield and vortex shield.

Tone titans are vulnerable with flanking and close quarters combat, be warned that close quarters combat can give them the ability to get lock ons so keep that in mind when engaging, use defensive abilities, electric smoke and dash to counter. Titans that can deal with Tone titans well are Tone, Northstar, Ronin, Ion and Scorch. If you try to get terminations on Tone titans you should be very careful as you can get punished heavily for that, instead it will be better to play it safe and destroy them from a distance. Tone titans aren’t that dangerous once the tracking rockets are dealt with making them easy cannon fodder.
