{:toc}

Name: Scorch

Size: Titan

Health type: High Titan Health(5 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Scorch titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Scorch titans will use the thermite launcher, thermal shield, flame wall, incendiary trap and flame core. All Scorch titans equip the wildfire launcher kit. 

## Movement/positions

When Scorch titans are deployed on the battlefield they make their way over to the harvester. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Scorch titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties. No unique abilities are added but it’s assumed that Scorch titans will be able to use flame core on master or above albeit it is extremely rare.

## Threat level and priority 

Enemy scorch titans are one of the most dangerous foes that the militia forces will face. Scorch titans should be prioritized when at a distance if possible. Scorch titans must not be near harvester or else mission failure is imminent. 

## Behavior

Soon after being deployed the Scorch titans will go towards the harvester in predetermined paths, Scorch titans will fire upon and engage any enemy forces in the way while enroute to harvester. Scorch titans will use their thermite launcher on distant pilots and any titans in view. If targeted by abilities or if taken heavy damage the Scorch Titan will use thermal shield to block incoming attacks, additionally Scorch titans will always use thermal shield on any nearby titans or pilots. Once a Scorch titan spots an enemy Titan it will slam down a flame wall and flame traps for massive area denial. If enough core meter has been gained the Scorch Titan will use flame core on any Titan or harvester in sight. 

## Strengths

Scorch titans serve as the frontal assault and area denial units in the IMC army, the Scorch titans have high health and the ability to block incoming projectiles making them very hard to kill. Scorch Titans excel in close quarters or hallway areas. Scorch titans deal incredible amounts of damage and will kill many pilots and titans with their wildfire launcher kit, making even mid range battles punishing against Scorch titans. Scorch titans are also accurate making them able to snipe pilots even while wall riding or rodeoing. Since Scorch titans deal so much damage it can prevent militia forces from advancing or roaming at all. Scorch titans themselves heavily punish Ronin titans, Monarch titans, and Tone titans due to the defensive thermal shield and area denial removing spaces which is what these titans need. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

The only one notable weakness that Scorch titans have is their inability to fight at long ranges, other than that Scorch titans can expend ridiculous amounts of damage seemingly out of nowhere making them incredibly unpredictable in all cases. For pilots Scorch titans are a serious threat from a distance and close up as the Scorch titans accuracy is incredibly good. As long as a scorch Titan doesn’t have you in its sights you should be fine. It is recommended you only engage scorch titans from a distance. Keep in mind that a thermal shield is always used if the pilot locks on with an archer. Thermal shields will also remove ordinances like satchels so flanking and attacking from behind is heavily recommended. A-wall can help considerably with surviving since you can stay behind the wall while firing on enemy Scorch titans. Don’t be surprised if you get sniped in the air or while moving from its thermite launcher as that is incredibly accurate for some reason. Speaking of, its thermite launcher uses the wildfire launcher kit making it deal insane amounts of damage should a thermite grenade land or hit on you as a pilot or Titan. Avoid rodeoing a Scorch if another easier Titan is nearby as you can die easily from its thermal shield, since thermal shield is a reactionary ability they will use it if your allies are attacking the same Scorch making it nearly impossible to predict when it uses it. As for titans, Scorch titans will melt your health and shields with any of its abilities.

When dealing with Scorches always watch out for thermite and deploy electric smoke if it needs to be smothered. Always assume the Scorch Titan will launch a thermite grenade at you so use defensive abilities as needed. Dash and electric smoke are pretty much needed to prevent damage from Scorch titans if that’s what you are dealing with. Always take elevations when possible to avoid thermite, still be mindful of its thermite grenades as you can lose half or even a 3 quarters of health in seconds. Never engage Scorch titans in melee combat unless you really know what you are doing, highlander Ronin is the only excuse. If you try to get a termination or try to battery steal on a Scorch you will be punished severely by its thermal shield. Always chip off health of Scorch titans from a distance if the opportunity presents itself, Scorch titans are a priority over other titans other than arc titans and mortar units. Try to bait out thermal shield use so it’s cooldown runs out, making fights easier. Something that all pilots will have to get used to is that thermal shield is pretty much impossible to counter, except one saving grace, arc traps! Arc traps will cancel and prevent Scorches from using abilities for a time, a good rule of thumb is to activate electric smoke on yourself to prevent Scorch titans from attacking you, do this and you will find Scorch titans easier to dispatch. Even with all the precautions taken place the margins of error are extremely slim. If you play as Tone or Legion try to bait out thermal shields as much as possible, titans like Northstar as well can snipe Scorch titans from a distance. Ion titans and Tone titans should keep in mind that their defensive abilities prevent thermite progression and any possibility of thermite grenades to deal damage by blocking them. Overall game sense and being smart will help you in the long run, respect the Scorch titans and you will survive long enough to see another day.
