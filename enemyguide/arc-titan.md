{: .no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

Name: Arc Titan(Ronin is parent chassis)

Size: Titan

Health type: Low Titan Health(3 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Arc titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Arc titans use the leadwall and broadsword, arc wave, sword block and phase dash. Arc titans have a passive arc field that damages nearby enemy forces and will instantly drain harvester shields; this is removed once doomed. Arc titans are believed to equip Ronin's thunderstorm kit. 

## Movement/positions

When Arc titans deploy on the map they run over to the harvester in predetermined paths. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Arc titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Arc titans are an incredible threat to militia forces and harvesters. Arc titans have the highest priority matching mortar titans. Militia forces must destroy arc titans before they reach the harvester. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Arc titans run to the harvester in determined paths. Arc titans will use leadwall on distanced targets like pilots, and will use broadswords on any nearby pilot or Titan. Will throw arc waves when nearby militia forces or harvesters. Arc titans will use sword blocks to defend against attacks, especially lock-on weapons. Phase dash is an ability they will use to dodge cores and other dangerous abilities. Arc titans have a unique arc field passive that they will purposely use against harvester.

## Strengths

Arc titans have a lot of abilities that make them very hard to kill, their sword block will reduce and make all attacks inefficient, phase dash will remove lock ons while dodging. Arc titans are nearly impossible to survive in during close quarters engagements with their lead wall, broadsword, arc wave and the arc field. Arc titans can counter particle walls and gun shields with arc waves. Arc titans are the most dangerous titans against pilots with their lead wall and broadsword that makes huge long range swipes and lastly the arc field. Arc titans are also effective harvester destroyers since they can drain the shields instantly making the harvester vulnerable to any attacks. Arc titans cannot be rodeod due to the arc field, which also makes them immune to arc traps until they are doomed. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit

Arc titans are an unforgiving skill check to your militia pilot team, arc titans only have two weaknesses, long distance battles and being in an elevated position, if you can engage arc titans in one or more in this way then your mission will be much easier. For pilots arc titans are instant death. The lead wall and broadsword attacks with arc field make all close and medium range engagements very dangerous, arc field makes arc titans kill pilots who try to rodeo and nuke rodeo so anti Titan weapons must be used over rodeoing.
Arc titans can also kill pilots rodeoing nearby IMC titans making them a rodeo deterrent. Arc titans will use their sword block and phase dash well so donâ€™t expect to deal a lot of damage to them with anti Titan weapons, simply put arc titans are super durable and dangerous, avoid if you can and run for your life to a safe distance before engaging. For titans, you must prioritize damaging incoming arc titans above all other enemies as they are immune to arc traps(assuming the map is covered in them), arc titans must not get near the harvester. Due to many arc titans appearing in groups, close quarters combat will always happen due to them being very durable, this means you must use electric smoke, cores and any penetrating/aoe abilities you have. Since arc titans have arc fields, any close engagements will always end up damaging your titan very fast. Electric smoke is the only saving grace you will have as that will buy you time, of course any phase dashes that they do will hopefully result in a phase dash death. A few noteworthy abilities that work well to counter them are tether traps, maelstrom electric smoke, close and long range power shot, and all Scorch abilities like thermal shield. Even with good pilots and good preparation arc titans will always shake up the battlefield. Monarch titans should avoid arc titans unless maelstrom and aegis are leveled so you can outheal and damage at the same time. Arc titans will be the deciding factor if a mission will be successful or not. Good luck on your next engagement pilot.
