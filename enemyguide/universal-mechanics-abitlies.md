## Introduction

This guide will include all of the shared mechanics and abilities of the IMC remnant forces in frontier defense that require elaboration. 

## Infantry health

All enemies in the infantry category can be instantly killed by titan melee or by stepping on them (the flyers like plasma drones and cloaked drones canâ€™t be stepped on). Almost all area of effect Titan abilities instant kill infantry units such as electric smoke.

## Low infantry health

Enemy units with Low infantry health can be melee/executed by a pilot or killed by a few bullets from a firearm. All pilot ordinances will instantly kill units in category.

## Medium infantry health 

More bullets will be required to kill but can still be instantly killed by melee. Some resistance to ordinances will be applied.

## High infantry health 

High infantry health units require much more bullets to kill, they are immune to executions and take 2 or more melee hits to kill. Ordinances like satchels or frag grenades will weaken and not kill these enemies with one throw. 

## Reaper health 

The exclusive health for the reaper unit, reapers have a WPV and can be damaged by all pilot weapons.

## Dash

All Enemy titans dash differently than player controlled titans. Regular dash is replaced with a side, front and back step. Multiple dashes can be used but it is unclear if they have cooldowns. If an enemy Titan is locked on by an archer or other abilities they will use a farther dash for evasion due to the increased threat.

## Titan melee

All Enemy titans have access to a few unique stronger melee attacks, usually in the form of a lunge ground smash that has a massive area of effect. Will instantly kill pilots and deal heavy damage to titans. It has a 480 degree or more effect that can even kill pilots mid air. Titans will lunge at enemy pilots from an unexpected distance so extreme caution is advised. 

## Core

All of the enemy titans except Scorch titans cannot use Core. 

## Terminations

Enemy titans cannot perform terminations 

## Titan kits 

It is unknown if enemy titans have Titan kits equipped. For the Titan exclusive kits each Titan and titan variant has them equipped(elaborated in each respective enemy titan guides) 

## Electric smoke 

Enemy titans cannot use electric smoke.

## Titanfall

All enemy titans deploy on the battlefield with Dome shield. All reaper units deploy via warpfall.

## Chassis shield 

All titans on master or insane deploy with full chassis shields.
