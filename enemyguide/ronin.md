{:toc}

Name: Ronin

Size: Titan

Health type: Low Titan Health(3 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Ronin titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Ronin titans use the leadwall and broadsword, arc wave, sword block and phase dash. Ricochet rounds are equipped for the kit. 

## Movement/positions

When Ronin titans deploy on the map they run over to the harvester in predetermined paths. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Ronin titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Ronin titans are a threat to the harvester and nearby titans. They can strip harvester shields in an arc wave making them a high priority threat. Ronin titans are also hard to kill making early engagements better.

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Ronin titans run to the harvester in determined paths. Ronin titans will use leadwall on distanced targets like pilots, and will use broadswords on any nearby pilot or Titan. Will throw arc waves when nearby militia forces or harvesters are in view. Ronin titans will use sword blocks to defend against attacks, especially lock-on weapons. Phase dash is an ability they will use to dodge cores and other dangerous abilities. 

## Strengths

Ronin titans have a lot of abilities that make them harder to kill, sword block will reduce and make all attacks inefficient, phase dash will remove lock ons while dodging. Ronins are dangerous in close quarters combat with their lead wall, broadsword and arc wave. Ronin titans can counter particle walls and gun shields with arc waves. Ronins are pretty good pilot hunters with their lead wall and broadsword that makes huge long range swipes. Ronin titans are also effective harvester destroyers since they can drain the shields very fast making the harvester vulnerable to any attacks.

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Ronin titans themselves are a rare occurrence in frontier defense, when they do spawn the militia forces must ensure they don’t get near the harvester to prevent harvester damage. Ronin titans do not do well in long distance battles but will still be very defensive and evasive at any combat range, therefore try to bait out phase dash and sword block as soon as possible, even though sword block will deflect most of your damage it is still recommended to focus on the Ronins. The only dangerous ranged attacks are leadwall and arc wave which both can be countered easily, leadwall doesn’t do that much damage and can be blocked by all defensive abilities. Arc wave is more dangerous as it can remove particle walls and gun shields while stunning you but that can be avoided by dashing to the side, or using a vortex shield and thermal shield. Elevated positions are perfect against Ronin titans as the Ronin’s have nothing to attack you with efficiently, arc waves don't travel up so that ability is rendered useless. When dealing with Ronins in close range combat they might phase dash into you, always try to predict where they will phase out so you can get a phase dash kill, arc traps can also cause phase dash deaths but this is inconsistent. Use electric smoke when dealing with Ronin titans in close quarters combat as this will damage and blind them making the fights much easier. Scorch titans in particular counter Ronin titans heavily so if a Scorch is on the team they should be in front. Ronin titans aren’t as bad since they rarely are deployed and if they are it’s usually 1. Pilots must be careful when being spotted by Ronin titans since leadwall will kill you instantly and broadsword so avoid going in front of the Ronin, flanks and distance will help you survive. Be cautious in your approach and you should live. So Ronin titans aren’t that bad, it’s the arc titans that you should be worried about.
