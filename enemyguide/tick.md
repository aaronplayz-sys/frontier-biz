Name: Tick

Size: Small

Health type: Low Infantry Health

## Method of deployment

Ticks deploy on the battlefield by drop pod or ejected from the back of a reaper. Ticks deploy in groups of 4 from drop pods and reapers.

## Arsenal

Ticks do not possess any weapons or abilities, instead they explode when near enemy pilots, titans and harvesters. Ticks will also immediately explode when damaged. 

## Movement/positions

Once ticks deploy on the battlefield they run towards the harvester in predictable paths, ticks will deviate if targets like pilots or titans are nearby and will chase targets. Ticks will jump to higher elevations if needed. Ticks have a subtle but distinctive clinking sound. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Ticks are one of the few enemy units that are exactly the same on all difficulties, damage and behavior are unchanged. 

## Threat level and priority 

Ticks are incredibly dangerous to pilots as pilots can die very easily to them. Ticks should be evaded and focused in order to prevent hull damage on your Titan. Ticks do burst damage and will drop harvester shields if enough detonate near it. 

## Behavior

After deploying, ticks will travel across the map to attack the harvester. Ticks will travel and follow pilots inside buildings and even jump on roofs in order to chase or move across the map. Ticks will detonate after a short warning. Tick detonations will detonate other nearby ticks. Ticks will instantly detonate if attacked. 

## Strengths

Ticks are a suicide unit and they do their job very well, ticks can kill even the most trained pilot as they can surprise unaware pilots very fast. Due to ticks exploding from being attacked, pilots can die indirectly by their teammates and turrets. Tick explosions are much bigger than what is seen. Ticks are also small so they can be harder to hit. Ticks also can chip away Titan and harvester health overtime making them weaken the militia forces. Ticks can provide good distractions for other IMC forces. Tick explosions bypass almost all defensive abilities on titans, these are but not limited to: vortex shield, thermal shield, particle wall, and gun shield. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit

Ticks if dealt with accordingly will not be much of a problem, ticks do not have a lot of health so ordinances and any other Titan weapons will dispatch them very fast. Grenade launchers also provide a good option for tick cleanups. The general rule is that space is your friend against ticks, never melee or step on ticks while in a Titan, use dash and electric smoke if needed. Tick explosions can be baited if they arenâ€™t fired upon, just make sure to evade very fast as the explosion radius is very far. Turrets can be a good tick cleanup tool but they can endanger pilots on the battlefield. The best way to deal with ticks is arc traps since arc traps instantly detonate ticks, making them the best way to remove the problem altogether. Pilots on tick infested maps who wish to pilot only should use wall riding and rigorous parkour tactics to evade ticks, do not underestimate ticks so evade them in every encounter. Memorize the tick paths and you will be safe.
As a pilot when on roofs you must be aware that ticks can jump near you and surprise you. Tacticals like stim, cloak and holo pilot are very useful to bait explosions and evade ticks. Gravity star can stop tick movements providing breathing room to destroy them. For titans electric smoke can be useful just make sure to dash away after deploying, all aoe abilities like cluster missile, predator cannon shotgun blast, tone 40mm cannon, splitter rifle alt fire, arc wave and more can destroy ticks easily.
