{:toc}

Name: Monarch

Size: Titan

Health type: Medium Titan Health(4 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Monarch titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Monarch titans use the XO-16 gun, rocket salvo, rearm and energy siphon. It is unknown what kits IMC Monarch units equip but it is assumed to be the default shield amplifier. It is unknown if Monarch titans use upgrade cores. 

## Movement/positions

When Monarch titans deploy on the map they move to the harvester in predetermined paths to the harvester. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Monarch titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Monarch titans are very weak against enemy pilots and titans but will destroy harvesters very quickly. Monarch titans should be prioritized if they are hitting the harvester or near it, when they are enroute they can be lower on priority list. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Monarch titans will go in predetermined paths, when spotting enemies they will use their XO-16, rocket salvo and energy siphon on enemy pilots, titans and harvester. Monarch titans typically stay farther back when engaging enemy forces. XO-16 will be used on any enemy in sight, rocket salvo and energy siphon have no priority on what the Monarch uses them on. 

## Strengths

Monarch titans are able to shoot targets with a hitscan gun, they are generally very weak but can strip harvester shields with energy siphon and rocket salvo, they also deal huge burst damage to harvester with XO-16, they can also shoot the harvester from far away on certain maps making them very high priority targets. Monarch’s in some cases are a bigger threat to operation success than any other IMC unit when harvester is in their sights. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Monarch titans are the weakest titan unit that the militia will face, due to this fact Monarch titans aren’t anything special, that is until they reach the harvester and their damage comes out of nowhere. Monarch titans don’t have anything noteworthy about fighting them other than that as a pilot make sure to avoid the rocket salvo as that can kill you instantly, energy siphon can hit you but won’t kill you so don’t panic if you are hit. Since XO-16 is very inaccurate you can fight Monarch titans medium or long range safely. Since Monarch titans don’t have any defensive ability that blocks attacks they are extremely easy to destroy with anti Titan weapons. For titans; Monarch titans can chip away health with their XO-16 so keep that in mind, their rocket salvos can deal some damage but those are easy to avoid, Monarch’s are very weak so any defensive abilities with any strat can kill them easily. One final note is that Monarch titans on maps like forward base Kodai or War games become incredibly dangerous to mission efforts as they will attack the harvester from a distance making their destruction a top priority.
