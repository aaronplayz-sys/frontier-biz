Name: Mortar Specter

Size: Small

Health type: Medium Infantry Health

## Method of deployment

Mortar specters are deployed by drop pods. Mortar specters deploy on the battlefield in squads of 4.

## Arsenal

Mortar specters possess a more sophisticated weaponry that consists of double take, volt, mastiff and more alike. Lastly each specter will possess a heavy rocket launcher that is only used against the harvester. Mortar specters will use melee if pilots get close. 

## Movement/positions

All mortar specters once deployed will run toward predetermined positions on the map, these include open spaces and elevated surfaces like rooftops. Mortar specters will not chase enemy pilots or titans. Once at the predetermined position they will not move anywhere else. 

## Difficulty level buffs

On hard and above they gain a particle shield that deploys facing the harvester. On harder difficulties their accuracy is increased like every other IMC unit. Damage dealt to harvesters is increased. 

## Threat level and priority 

Mortar specters must be destroyed as soon as they spawn since they are a threat to the harvester itself, the militia forces should roam for them as soon as they spawn. If left alone harvester death is guaranteed. 

## Behavior

Mortar specters once deployed will make their way promptly to their designated locations. Once at the position they will deploy their rocket launchers and fire at the harvester indefinitely. Mortar specters will fire upon pilots and titans while enroute to their location but will not chase. Mortar specters will not use their rocket launcher against militia titans. Mortar specters prioritize attacking harvester than nearby pilots and titans.

## Strengths

Mortar specters themselves don’t have too many strengths but will force the militia forces to roam and snipe their locations to prevent harvester death, mortar specters can take longer to kill once their particle walls are deployed. They also have more durable health than grunts requiring pilots to put more bullets and effort into their destruction.

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit

Mortar specters are easy to dispatch since they are infantry so ordinances and aoe abilities kill them fast. For pilots on big open maps sniper rifles are recommended to snipe mortar nests. The quicker mortar specters are dispatched the better off the round will be for the players. In general any weapon can kill them fast like grenade launchers can be an efficient way to dispatch mortar specters. Kill mortar specters when they are enroute so you don’t have to deal with the particle walls. When mortar specters spawn on waves 2-5 make sure to kill them all asap. Titans have absolutely no problem dealing with mortar specters other than that they can be out of reach since nests typically are on roofs, pilots should exit Titan if need be to dispatch the mortar specters.
