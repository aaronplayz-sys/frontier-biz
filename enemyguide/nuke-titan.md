# Nuke Titan
{: .no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

Name: Nuke Titan(Legion is parent chassis)

Size: Titan

Health type: High Titan Health(5 blocks) will always deploys with full chassis shields regardless of difficulty. 

## Method of deployment

Nuke titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Nuke titans use the predator cannon, power shot and gun shield. Legion titans have the nuke ejection kit equipped. It is believed that Legion titans use Legion’s bulwark kit. Nuke titans cannot melee. Nuclear ejection activates as soon as the doomed state is reached. 

## Movement/positions

When deployed on the map they will go in predictable paths to the harvester. If they deviate from the path and can’t get back they will self detonate. Nuke titans can run while predator cannon is revved up. Nuke titans get very close to the harvester to detonate on it. If a nuke Titan isn’t stunned or damaged they will run towards the harvester. Nuke titans cannot use dash.

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, nuke titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Nuke titans are one of the weaker damaging titans that the militia will face, they do not do a lot of damage to pilots or titans unless given enough time to fire. Nuke titans aren’t as much of a priority when compared to arc titans unless they are nearing the harvesters, never let nuke titans near harvester at all costs. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map nuke titans will go towards the harvester, any nearby enemies in line of sight will be fired upon with predator cannon, power shot will be used on pilots or titans in view, typically nuke titans will only use close range mode. When nuke titans take damage they will deploy a gun shield and return fire. 

## Strengths

Nuke titans are effective bullet sponges for the IMC forces, they don’t do a lot of damage but can still lay down heavy consistent fire on militia titans, close range power shot can kill damaged pilots instantly. Gun shields make them extremely durable since the bulwark kit is equipped making them incredibly strong since most battles are face to face. Nuke titans force out defensive tactics as they will destroy harvesters very fast if left untouched leaving room for opportunity for other IMC units. Since nuke titans always nuke eject when doomed, militia forces can get destroyed in the process of defending. 

Nuke titans are a major threat to the harvester and militia operations, they only have 2 attacks and move slowly making them easy targets but durable targets, one issue is that they can absorb ton of damage therefore distracting militia forces from more dangerous units, nuke ejection must be respected and predicted to prevent Titan, pilot and harvester death, as for pilots make sure not to move too slowly and avoid being in the crossfire as you can die from close range power shots, it requires 2 shots to kill full health pilots so keep that in mind. Nuke titans are accurate but don’t move their chassis fast making it very easy to dodge their attacks, always use high ground and movement mechanics against Nuke Titans for easy dispatch. Always prepare for nuke ejection, equipping phase shift or stim can help with survivability. When rodeoing nuke titans always keep an eye out for the nuke titans health on all of them as nuke eject can kill pilots while rodeoing. Luckily nuke titans will not melee at all making them perfect battery farms for pilots.

For titans all defensive abilities and electric smokes pretty much make the nuke titans harmless, always aim for weak point vulnerabilities since nuke titans have so much health. Nuke titans will damage your Titan if it’s exposed long enough so use cover when available. Nuke titans are very susceptible to static or area of effect abilities like thermite due to them not being able to dash. Elevated and flanking positions against nuke titans are pretty much a guaranteed win as nuke titans can’t defend all sides at once. Arc traps counter nuke titans even further since they can instantly deplete an active gun shield and nuke Titan chassis shields, additionally arc traps prevent them from running with their stun. Nuke titans are basically core meter/sword core feed. Remember to avoid the powershot and you will do fine against nuke titans. On the final topic of nuke ejection, nuke ejection must be respected or else death or severe damage can occur on your Titan, always use any evasive maneuvers like dash or phase dash to escape it. Good abilities for nuke titans are warp/dome shield titan falls if timed right can kill and block nuke titans bypassing nuke ejection. If done shield is selected then the Titan inside is perfectly safe from the subsequent nuke ejections. All nuke ejections can be bypassed with flame core granted the nuke titan(s) have low enough health, and the Legion’s close range power shot aegis can bypass their nuke eject as well. Northstar tether can be an invaluable asset as it can haunt a line up of nuke titans buying the team essential time. Nuke titans cannot be terminated so never try to achieve those. In close to losing moments where nuke titans are very close to harvester, if one player has a harvester shield ability that they bought from armory they can let the nuke titans detonate on the harvester, as long as it’s timed right before the first initial explosion the harvester should be able to survive.
Titan melee can push nuke titans back as well if needed, make sure to combine with electric smoke to prevent damage.

Monarch maelstrom is a perfect tool against nuke titans. Nuke ejection itself is another good counter to nuke titans as they cant dash away from it. Ronins arc wave can deal penetration stun and some damage making it a good tool as well. Nuke titan spawns on some maps are very extreme making arc traps a must. Always focus arc titans first before attacking nuke titans as they aren’t stunned by arc traps therefore making them a higher priority if arc titans spawn on said map.
