{:toc}

Name: Northstar(Sniper Titan)

Size: Titan

Health type: Low Titan Health(3 blocks)

## Method of deployment

Northstar titans deploy on the battlefield in a dome shield.

## Arsenal

Northstar Titan will use plasma railgun, cluster missile, tether trap and hover. It is unclear what kit they use but it is assumed it is piercing shot kit.

## Movement/positions

When Northstar titans are deployed on the battlefield they walk towards predetermined static positions around the map. Northstar titans do not deviate but will engage and chase targets that go near them or while enroute. 

## Difficulty level buffs

Like most enemies in frontier defense, Northstar titans gain increased a.I, damage and health on harder difficulties.

## Threat level and priority 

Northstar titans that are positioned in a way so that they can hit the harvester must be dealt with promptly, they can damage the harvester if left unchecked. Northstar titans that are in positions far away from the harvester can be dealt with last as they won’t hurt the harvester. Northstar titans are very dangerous to militia pilots as they can snipe them, even when pilots are in the air. Militia titans can easily dispatch Northstars most of the time. 

## Behavior

Once deployed on the map Northstar titans move to their predetermined spots, they will not move unless dashing out of the way of danger and to chase nearby pilots after a rodeo. Once they reach their location they will provide overwatch for the IMC forces until they are destroyed, or if they have a harvester in line of sight they will focus on that instead. Northstar titans are perceptive and will focus pilots on the battlefield over titans. Northstar Titans will use cluster missiles on enemy titans and even pilots. Tether traps are deployed for defending their positions. Hover will be used often and mostly at the beginning of combat to avoid nearby threats. 

## Strengths

Northstar titans excel at killing pilots with their very good accuracy and cluster missile therefore making pilot only and ejections very risky for militia pilots. Other than that they aren’t as big of a threat as other IMC Titan units, Northstar titans can supplement damage and weaken militia titans all match. They can lay tether for unsuspecting militia titans possibly causing Titan death. Cluster missiles can also cause serious damage to slow titans or trapped titans. Northstar titans that focus on harvesters force militia pilots to roam to combat them. When Northstar titans use hover they are harder to rodeo and do terminations on. 

## Weaknesses/how to win against unit 

Northstar titans have a lot of weaknesses but can be very unpredictable at times. Pilots engaging against Northstar titans must have extreme caution, pilots should go behind cover and use long range weapons if possible, cloak and holo Pilot can help but Northstars are incredibly accurate with fast reflexes, generally you will want to avoid attacking Northstar titans to avoid death. Rodeoing Northstar titans in particular is one of the most risky actions you can do, Northstar titans in particular will chase pilots who rodeod them and will fire upon them until line of sight is broken. Watch out for Northstars who hover, your chances of being shot increase so death is likely, therefore try to rodeo from an elevated position. In summary just break line of sight and you will be fine, consider equipping cloak for easier rodeo and engagement. For titans Northstar titans are more of a nuisance than a serious threat, Northstars can still deal damage but not much considering how much damage other titans do, watch out for cluster missiles which is easy to avoid by dashing out of the way, Northstars will also deploy tethers so look out for those near their nests, Northstar titans like to hover making them very easy targets to deal with, take full advantage if you see a hovering Northstar. During the match it is still recommended that you stay out of sight to avoid getting damaged from Northstars overtime. As always Northstars that attack the harvester must be destroyed asap. Defensive abilities work extremely well in Northstar titans, since they only have 3 bars of health most ordinances doom them easily. Roamer titans like Ronin should focus on sniper titans since they are far out in the map, allowing the other titans to focus on other enemies.
Of course other long range titans like Legion or Northstars can deal with them as well. Overall Northstar titans are one of the weaker enemies to deal with in a Titan.
