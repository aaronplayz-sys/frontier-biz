# Anti Titain Weapons
{: .no_toc}

All Pilots are given access to anti titan weapons, anti Titan weapons are an incredible tool for pilots in multiplayer and frontier defense. Every pilot will enter the battlefield with one. Picking the right anti titan weapon for the pilotâ€™s skill and play-style varies but all anti titan weapons do the same thing, easily damage titans and reapers. Normally primary weapons must hit weak point vulnerabilities to do damage but the anti Titan weapons do not have this problem. All anti Titan weapons still benefit from hitting WPV.

There are a total of 4 Anti titan weapons to choose from.

On easy, normal and hard the anti titan weapons will have infinite ammo but on master and insane they will have the multilayer equivalent of reserve ammunition. If you die or every time you eject from your doomed titan your reserves get replenished.

## Charge Rifle

Clipless anti titan sniper rifle that is hit scan, the charge rifle requires a charge up then automatically fires once charge is full. Charge rifle favors pilots who are further back and who rely on range to attack titans. Make sure to hit headshots for maximum damage. Charge rifle requires more aim skill than other anti-titan weapons. Extra ammo and gun ready mod are recommended when using a charge rifle. Charge hack mod should be used on hard or below difficulties for more dps, because of the limited ammo you want the shots to do more damage. Or if you have amped weapons then use charge hack for quicker Titan meter.

## MGL-Mag Launcher

The mag launcher is a projectile magnetic launcher. It is the perfect run and gun anti titan weapon, the mag launcher can even magnetize towards drones and stalkers as those count as metal targets, not just titans and reapers. Since the grenades follow titans, it is very easy to aim and hit big targets. With a surprisingly long range it can be used on every map. Mag launcher can hit enemies behind obstacles (do this by shooting the empty space next to them if they are behind cover or over them if on a roof). The mag launcher is also the safest anti titan weapon for close range since you can abuse the magnetism mechanic of the mag launcher without putting yourself in sight. It does a moderate amount of AOE damage if multiple titans are in an area, I consider the mag launcher to be the best close range anti titan weapon. The strength of the mag launcher is its easy aim, strength against single titans and the ability to shoot from a safe area. Use speedloader and extra ammo mods for maximum effectiveness.

## LG-97-Thunderbolt

The Thunderbolt has the highest damage potential out of all of the anti titan weapons. Upon pulling the trigger, it will shoot a ball of electricity that moves slowly to where the pilot aims, if an enemy gets nearby they will get damaged. If an enemy gets hit directly it will take a chunk of damage off but the bolt disappears. It is perfect for maps with long pathways. Thunderbolt shines when multiple titans and reapers clump up together. A good placed thunderbolt shot can earn a titanfall in less than a second. The only weakness is that the projectile can be dodged easily and you have limited ammo so you need to place shots carefully so titans can run into them before running out of ammo. It also has 1 firing capacity so each shot will need to do a reload before firing again. Subsequently It is not the best to use on a single titan but it will deal huge damage to a lot of titans if they are squished together. If you are fighting a single titan make sure to get direct hits for maximum damage. A unique and high skill trick with satchels is by predicting where a Titan will be by shooting thunderbolt then throwing the satchel on the same path as thunderbolt causing the satchel and thunderbolt to collide causing it to detonate mid air. This makes for a cool high skill combo.

## Archer

The Archer is a rocket launcher with anti titan/reaper lock-on. The archer will deal one block of damage if it hits a titan or it will 2 shot a reaper. The archer is in between the charge rifle and the thunderbolt in terms of function. High single fire damage. Has little AOE, it has a very far lock-on range. This is the most skilled anti titan weapon in the game as it has many counters. To use efficiently one must learn how the rocket tracks and follows targets. Its damage output is good but it doesn't have much AOE. Good for 1st wave missions with lots of titans. The mods I recommend are Speedloader, extra ammo(master or insane) and gun ready. These will increase the dps by having faster aiming and reloading, or you can get extra ammo for more hits. The archer unlike the charge rifle is easier to dodge as titans will be aware you are locking on. When fired the rocket will take some time depending on the distance to hit the titan. This is a very good weapon if you are on open maps. Since you must aim before shooting this can make run and gun much harder therefore this weapon is best used at a distance. Titans and reapers will counter the archer rocket by dodging out of the way or using abilities, therefore making the archer not friendly for lower skilled players. A benefit though is that you don't have to really aim to use the Archer. Make sure you fire above the targeted enemy so the rocket wont hit any map obstacles or something else that's in the way.

Archer does have good dps with the right mods. On hard or below difficulties it can actually be a very powerful tool for pilot-only styles if the pilot is persistent with lockons and spamming the launch button(left click) as soon as the archer locks on. Very strong for fighting single titans. It will require two rockets or one amped rocket to kill a reaper, therefore using an A-wall with archer is recommended.

## Summary
{: .no_toc}

To summarize, each player will have a different style they will like. Ultimately with the right loadouts like picking ordnance like satchel and equipping grenade launchers, these can makeup for any dps loss or inconsistencies the anti titan weapons will have. We recommend all players at least use all of the 4 to get a feel for what they like.
