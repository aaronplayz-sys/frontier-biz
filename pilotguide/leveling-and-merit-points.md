# Leveling and Merit Points
{: .no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

This guide will cover everything on leveling and the merit points associated with unlocking banners, badges, factions, skins, weapons, tacticals, ordnances, pilot kits, boosts, loadouts, executions, titans, titan kits and titan terminations. 

## Merits

To start, Titanfall 2 has an in-game currency called merits. Merits are earned through various ways that are: rewards that are sent to your inbox and given upon opening or it is a random skin that has not been bought yet. Leveling anything up, completing aegis ranks, leveling pilot generation. Merits can be used to unlock everything mentioned previously but some skins or executions/terminations in the game are locked behind achievements or paywalls. There is no limit to how many merits you can save up. Once something is purchased with merits it is unlocked forever therefore you don't have to wait for your pilot generation to be high enough for that unlock ever again. There are no refunds so once merit points are spent you will have to earn more through gameplay. To see how many merits you have currently earned, press your menu button and you will see it on the bottom right of screen as shown below.

## KEEP IN MIND

Merits will not be earned if you are playing on a private server match. If you leave before a match is completed (win or lose) you will lose all merits earned in that match. 

## Leveling and Pilot Generation 

Titanfall2â€™s leveling system is fairly simple, the more you play and the better you play at the game the more levels and merits you earn. Let's start with the pilot generation level. Pilot generation levels are earned through leveling everything else in the game such as titan levels or weapon levels, victories, successful escapes, mvp, faction level up and more will contribute to pilot generation levels. Each pilot generation level has 50 subsequent levels that need to be leveled before reaching the next generation level (for factions its only 2 chunks, each victory gives one chunk). As shown it can look like for example #5.34. The maximum level is generation 100 for everything. After generation 100 any experience points stop being earned for that unlock. When ##.49 points have been reached then regeneration will be available, regeneration will reset your pilot level to ##.00 but your generation level will now increase by 1, so anything that wasn't bought with merits will now have to be unlocked again. Regenerating is the only way to continuously earn merit points so always regenerate as soon as it is unlocked or else you throw away subsequent earnings. Many banners and skins require reaching higher generation levels to be unlocked. Each level will have divided milestones or leveling chunks, depending on the subsequent level, if it's on the lower end or higher end it can have a few or multiple chunks needed before the next generation level is unlocked. When its level ##.00 to ##.03 or so it will require very little milestones but in higher subsequent levels it will require more leveling chunks, this only applies to pilot levels, weapons and titans. This will reset every time a generation level is earned. Only pilot generation levels require you to manually regenerate, everything else in the game automatically goes to the next generation level. 

## Weapon and Titan Leveling 

All Weapons but ordinances in titanfall 2 can level when used in missions. When a weapon kills or assists in titan or pilot kills it will gain a level chunk, this level chunk is briefly shown (as shown in the picture below), enemies such as reapers or grunts require you to be the one with the final hit to earn a level chunk. Ticks do not earn level chunks. Weapons and titans only require 20 subsequent levels in order to earn a generation level. As for titans, titans gain level chunks when killing enemies, assisting in pilot or titan kills, titanfall, cores, and ejections. Auto titans will also give your titan xp. 

## Leveling Pilot Weapons on Frontier Defense


For those who wish to level the weapons in frontier defense. Weapons will gain experience when killing enemies or damaging titans. (last bullet or projectile to cause death) When leveling weapons make sure to either kill doomed titans or damage titans enough so when they are killed by something or someone else you will earn a level chunk. Make sure to damage as many titans you can so you can get the assists, titan kill assist will give the same level chunk amount as kills. Use your anti titan or auto titan to damage enemy titans then finish them off with your weaker primary or sidearm if that's what you are leveling. You can still get weapon level chunks if your auto titan is the one to kill the titan you are fighting, it will just not show it as your Scorch leveling is prioritized, although this will need more testing.
