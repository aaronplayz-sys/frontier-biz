# Leveling and Merit Points
{: .no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

This guide will cover everything on leveling, merit points and credits associated with unlocking banners, badges, factions, skins, weapons, tacticals, ordnances, pilot kits, boosts, loadouts, executions, titans, titan kits, and titan terminations. 

## Credits

To start, Titanfall 2 has an in-game currency called credits. Credits are earned through various ways, including rewards sent to your inbox upon opening and random skins that have not been purchased yet. Credits are also learned by leveling anything up, completing aegis ranks, and leveling pilot generation. Credits can be used to unlock everything mentioned previously, but some skins and executions/terminations in the game are locked behind achievements or paywalls. There is no limit to the number of credits you can save up. Once something is purchased with credits, it is unlocked forever; therefore, you don't have to wait for your pilot generation to be high enough for that unlock ever again. There are no refunds, so once credits are spent, you will have to earn more through gameplay. To see how many credits, merits and levels you have currently earned, press your menu button, and you will see it on the bottom right of the screen, as shown below.

## KEEP IN MIND

Merits will not be earned if you are playing in a private server match. If you leave before a match is completed (win or lose), you will lose all merits earned in that match. Excluding weapon and titan leveling. 

## Leveling/Merit and Pilot Generation 

Titanfall 2â€™s leveling system is fairly simple; the more you play and the better you play at the game, the more levels and merits you earn. Let's start with the pilot generation level. Pilot generation levels are earned by merit points roughly 10 merits per subsequent level. Merit points are earned by leveling everything else in the game, such as titan levels or weapon levels, victories, successful escapes, mvp, faction level up and more will contribute to pilot generation levels. Each pilot generation level has 50 subsequent levels that need to be leveled before reaching the next generation level. As shown, it can look like, for example, #5.34. The maximum level is generation 100 for everything. After generation 100, any merit points stop being earned for that unlock. When ##.49 points have been reached, then regeneration will be available. Regeneration will reset your pilot level to ##.00, but your generation level will now increase by 1, after regenerating, anything that wasn't bought with merits will now have to be unlocked again. Regenerating is the only way to continuously earn merit points, so always regenerate as soon as it is unlocked, or else you throw away subsequent earnings. Many banners and skins require reaching higher generation levels to be unlocked. Each level will have divided milestones or leveling chunks, depending on the subsequent level. If it's on the lower end or higher end, it can have a few or multiple chunks needed before the next generation level is unlocked. When its level ##.00 to ##.03 or so, it will require very few milestones, but in higher subsequent levels, it will require more leveling chunks. This only applies to pilot levels, weapons, and titans. This will reset every time a generation level is earned. Only pilot generation levels require you to manually regenerate; everything else in the game automatically goes to the next generation level. 

## Weapon and Titan Leveling 

All Weapons but ordinances in Titanfall 2 can level when used in missions. When a weapon kills or assists in titan or pilot kills, it will gain a level chunk. This level chunk is briefly shown (as shown in the picture below); enemies such as reapers or grunts require you to be the one with the final hit to earn a level chunk. Ticks do not earn level chunks. Weapons and Titans only require 20 subsequent levels to earn a generation level. As for titans, titans gain level chunks when killing enemies, assisting in pilot or titan kills, titanfall, cores, and ejections. Auto titans will also give you Titan XP. 

## Leveling Pilot Weapons on Frontier Defense

For those who wish to level the weapons in frontier defense. Weapons will gain experience when killing enemies or damaging titans. (last bullet or projectile to cause death) When leveling weapons, make sure to either kill doomed titans or damage titans enough so that when they are killed by something or someone else, you will earn a level chunk. Make sure to damage as many titans as you can so you can get the assists. Titan kill assist will give the same level chunk amount as kills. Use your anti-titan or auto titan to damage enemy titans, then finish them off with your weaker primary or sidearm if that's what you are leveling. You can still get weapon level chunks if your auto titan is the one to kill the titan you are fighting; it will just not show it as your Scorch leveling is prioritized, although this will need more testing.
