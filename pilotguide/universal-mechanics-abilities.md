# Universal Mechanics and Abilities
{: .no_toc}

All pilots share these abilities and passives regardless of what is picked on loudouts or maps, these are:

- TOC
{:toc}

## Jump kit

All pilots are equipped with a personalized jump kit. The jump kit provides the pilot with the ability to double jump and wall ride with enhancements to sliding, running, and climbing. The jump kit is the basis for all movement mechanics in Titanfall 2. Pilots can crouch hop and strafe in mid-air for insane movements. Tacticals like grapple and stim offer more ways to achieve better movement making you harder to hit. (For more information on movement refer to the [movement guide]).

## Rodeo

When a pilot is near a Titan they can climb on and initiate a rodeo. Enemy rodeos pull a battery and heavily damage the enemy Titan while rodeoing on ally Titans prevent enemy rodeos and assist the ally Titan by inserting a battery into it if one was acquired before ally rodeo. (More elaborated on the [rodeo guide]).

## Melee

All pilots, grunts, specters, and stalkers can melee. Melee will deal heavy damage so avoid it at all costs. Pilots meleeing other pilots is an instant kill. If you are close enough you will lunge at the enemy closing the distance fast, if you are moving at a very high speed from strafing or other methods your melee lunge speed is enhanced making it even deadlier and quicker. Melee does nothing to reapers and titans so don’t use it on those enemies. Meleeing a tick will cause instant death. Melee will instantly destroy turrets and plasma drones. A useful ability for sure, just requires lightning reflexes to prevent getting meleed yourself.

## Execution

Executions are a cinematic killing of a target. Multiple different executions can be bought and unlocked after certain feats are completed. Executions are activated when the target's back is facing the pilot, executions do not make either pilot immune so it's possible to prevent the victim from dying. Executions can be used on grunts, specters, and enemy pilots. Stalkers are immune to execution and will instead initiate a power supply destruction.

## Primary Weapon

The main weapon that pretty much dictates the loadout and play style, primary weapons have the most choices that pilots can choose from. (Seek the [primary weapons guide] for all of the information).

## Anti Titain Weapon

These weapons are made to damage enemy titans. They have limited ammo in most game modes. ([Anti weapons guide] has full information).

## Sidearm

All pilots have a sidearm that can be used as a last resort if the primary weapon is empty. Only 3 sidearms are in the game, them being the p2hammond2016, the 45 auto pistol, and the b3 wingman. They do decent damage up close but have a very short falloff. (Look to the [primary weapons guide] for more information).

## Weapon Mods

Mods give weapons buffs and bonuses that suit the needs of the pilot (look for [mod and sight guide] for more info).

## Weapon Sights

The sights that guns have in the game serve different play styles and needs, it’s up to the pilot with which ones they choose. ([Mods and weapon sights guide] have any other info you need).

## Pilot Kit

Various kits that buff or add new abilities to help the pilot. (The [kit guide] have the information if needed.)

## Tactical

Tacticals serve as the main ability that the pilot has, with many different uses for each tactical, long cooldowns with different character models associated with each. (Refer to the [tactical guide] for more detail).

## Ordnance

Throwable weapons that detonate releasing harmful effects in an area. (Look to into the [ordnance guide] for more information.)

## Battery

Batteries are earned from successful rodeos or activating the battery backup boost. On frontier defense, an amped version can be bought from the armory (more of that in the [economy and armory guide]). Batteries give 100 percent chassis shields on your Titan or allied Titans while healing some chassis health. They additionally provide 10 core meters to the Titan that the battery was given to. Batteries are dropped if the pilot carrying them dies. Batteries on the map will disappear under unknown and unpredictable amount of time so make sure to pick them up.

## Boost

One-time use abilities earned with Titan meter that provide a wide variety of ways to help you or your team. (More elaborated in [boost guide]).

## Data Knife

All pilots Carry a small knife capable of hacking, only in multiplayer modes can a pilot go behind specters and hack them to turn them on the pilot’s side.

## Loadout

Players can have and customize up to 10 loadouts after unlocking or buying them. Loadouts can be renamed as well. Many different colors can be attached to the pilot, Titan, and their weapons if the colors are unlocked. Load-outs are very important and must be well thought out for maximum performance. A big crucial part of Titanfall 2. (The [Loadout guide] has all of the other information needed).

## Titan Meter

The Titan meter is the bottom left meter that measures boost and titanfall progression. The meter is earned by enemy deaths. There are two types of Titan meter, permanent and non-permanent, non-permanent meter deteriorates after a small amount of time and disappears after death. Permanent stays until reaching 100 meter. Small enemies like stalkers and grunts give you non-permanent meters while Pilots and Titan deaths give a huge bounty of meters that is permanent. After reaching a certain amount of Titan meter with a non-permanent Titan meter it will allow you to use your boost, if you die before using the boost you will have to earn it again by getting more Titan meter. If you reach 100 Titan meter by any means it will stay locked at 100 regardless of death or not. At 100 Titan meter, you can call down your Titan when and where you choose to. On frontier defense all Titan meter gains are permanent, meaning you won’t lose any meter from dying. Permanent Titan meter regenerates by itself overtime at a slow pace if you don’t have a Titan, this means you can leave 1 enemy behind on frontier defense to let everyone get a fresh new Titan if possible. Titan meter can be gained again once your Titan dies. A kit that pilots can use to help get more Titan meter is Titan Hunter.

## Titainfall

After 100 Titan meter is earned by a pilot the pilot can initiate a Titan fall at any time. Titan falls land where the pilot aims so for accurate landings aim where you want it. If it is not initiated on flat terrain it will do the next clear spot, often somewhere distant. Do be careful, make sure there isn’t a ceiling where you plan to call down to reduce the risk of a deviant titanfall. Titan falls will not hurt you or your allies. (If you need more information about Titanfalls go to the Titanfalls and their kits guide[^1]).
