## Introduction

Boosts are one-time activation abilities that are earned with the Titan meter, each boost has a different Titan meter cost. They are all different with many ways to provide a battlefield advantage over your opponents. Boosts can only be changed at the beginning of the round.

Frontier defense does not have boosts but does have an armory that provides items and abilities (look at the armory economy guide for more information).

Boosts can be earned with the temporary Titan meter but will not be accessible if the pilot dies. (More on the Titan meter in universal mechanics and abilities) once earned it can stack in the pilot “pocket” to a maximum of 5. Only one boost can be earned per titan life so any Titan meter earned while your Titan is on the battlefield no longer counts forward your meter

These are the 12 boosts with each activation cost:

|      Boost      | Activation Cost |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
|  Amped Weapons  |       80%       |
|      Ticks      |       65%       |
|  Pilot Sentry   |       72%       |
|    Map Hack     |       70%       |
| Battery Backup  |       80%       |
|  Radar Jammer   |       40%       |
|  Titan Sentry   |       35%       |
|  Smart Pistol   |       60%       |
|  Phase Rewind   |       24%       |
|   Hard Cover    |       20%       |
| Holo Pilot Nova |       40%       |
|    Dice Roll    |       50%       |

## Amped Weapons

Upon activation Amped weapons give you a damage buff to all of your equipped weapons for a limited time. Does not affect your ordinances or tactics. Will not stack with an amped wall. Amped weapons will be removed if dead or the timer runs out. This boost is great for any map and play style, anti Titan loadouts get buffed especially.

## Ticks

Upon activation 2 ticks will be placed in your inventory, activate the appropriate button to throw a tick just like an ordnance, after a short activation time they will go around towards enemies. Ticks will explode near enemies and will do friendly fire towards you. After a certain amount of time, they will run out of time and explode. Ticks are a funny boost to add chaos on the battlefield, essentially walking land mines they can kill an unaware pilot fast. Make sure to stay at a distance to destroy any hostile ticks.

## Pilot Sentry

A stationary sentry that attacks enemies automatically, the pilot sentry will kill grunts and stalkers well but with pilots not so much. Combine with an amped wall to provide protection. Sentry’s will die to a melee so flank them for easy dispatch. Arc grenades can stun the turret. Maximum of 2 per pilot.

## Map Hack

Shows the silhouettes of all enemies to you and allies through walls for a short time. Very useful for intel and ambush plays, map hack will be announced to enemy team.

## Battery Backup

Upon activation will put a battery on the pilots back, this is an extremely useful boost as it can be used on your own Titan or a friendly Titan giving you a lot of meter. Make sure not to activate in a dangerous situation to avoid having an enemy pick it up. If a battery is already on your pilot it will be dropped on the floor.

## Radar Jammer

Jamms the enemies minimap radar by making it go black. Perfect for giving your team a tactical edge.

## Titan Sentry

A more robust sentry that shoots plasma rockets at enemies. Designed against titans, arc turrets and melee will destroy the turret. Maximum of 2 per person.

## Smart Pistol

Upon activation will replace your second weapon with the smart pistol. Smart pistol has 12 rounds with 1 extra magazine. Very good weapon to farm Titan meter with. Any enemies locked on will get hit guaranteed. Enemy pilots will be notified of your general direction if you are locked on so equipping the cloak with the smart pistol is a good idea. Smart pistols won't one-shot pilots but will stack lock-ons, wait till the lock-on is red then fire.

## Phase Rewind

Once used will teleport the pilot back to a location the pilot was in a few seconds ago. A good boost to evade danger and death. Be warned though that if any enemy is at the spot that you will be teleported too they will kill you instantly.

## Hard Cover

The hard cover is a non amped version of the amped wall. Provides 360 protection to where you are facing when deploying. Good to combo with another amped wall. Sharpshooting is recommended if this boost is used.

## Holo Pilot Nova

Upon activation, a small army of holograms will go in all directions. Funny boost that can save your life.

## Dice Roll

Randomly select any of the 11 boosts every time it’s earned, stacks of different boosts are allowed.
