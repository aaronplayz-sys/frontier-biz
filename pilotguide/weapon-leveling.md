# Weapon Levling

A quick and unique guide on those who wish to level the weapons in frontier defense. Weapons will gain experience when killing enemies or damaging titans. (last bullet or projectile to cause death) When leveling weapons make sure to kill doomed titans so you can get the maximum experience, titan kill assist will give experience as well. You can get an assist by dealing any amount of damage sometime before death. Use your anti titan or auto titan to damage enemy titans then finish them off or communicate with your team.
