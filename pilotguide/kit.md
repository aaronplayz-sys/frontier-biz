## Kit 1

Kit one has the most playstyle influenced perks/abilities.

### Power Cell

Tactical has a shorter cooldown

Power cell is perfect for those who rely on tactical abilities often, it can also help with long cooldown like cloak, A-wall or stim. A good pick for any situation and map. Power cell acts like an investment. 

### Fast Regen

Health regeneration begins sooner

Fast Regen is a good kit for those who are newer and who do close combat. Since it only has value if the pilot is damaged, this is not as optimal on master and insane difficulties, where you need to do the maximum amount of damage as soon as possible. 

### Ordnance Expert

Ordnance has a faster cooldown and enables you to see the projected trajectory of your ordnance. 

Very useful for pilots who use ordnance often, it can benefit less skilled players who use this kit. Particularly useful for pilots who use satchels, faster cooldown means more damage overall.

### Phase Embark

Pilot enters and exits the titan more quickly.

A good kit to take if you're on waves 2 - 5. Make sure to not select this on the 1st wave(pilot only waves). Phase embark can be useful if you need to get batteries or repair turrets. If your titan dies often perhaps take the other kits to invest in more pilot gameplay. Pick this if you're unsure what to use on waves 2-5. Obviously do not equip this if you decide to go pilot only on waves 2-5

## Kit 2

Kit 2 kits offer a different and sometimes a niche set of benefits

### Kill Report

Enemy death locations are marked by skulls on the map.

Kill report has no use on frontier defense because there are no enemy pilots to fight, never pick this kit if you are going to play on FD. 

### Wall Hang

Hang onto walls by aiming while wall running.

Wall hang has its advantages and disadvantages, The ability to stay in one spot while up high can be useful for pilots to fight dangerous titans. It can also help avoid death when you eject from titan if you're going to fall onto thermite or nuke ejects if there are walls around you. It can also stop your speed completely when you need to aim while wallrunning, don't pick this if you are a run and gun style pilot or if you rely on aiming. Pilot will fall after a short time. Remember that your muscle memory will need to adapt differently if you decide to pick this kit.

### Hover

Hovers if the pilot aims in mid air. 

Hover is wall hang but better, it allows you to stay mid air while aiming letting you get better shots in. This can make it easy for enemies to target you so be cautious. Without the need to wall ride you can use hover on any map. Hover cant be used twice in mid air so if you activate it make sure to use it for its whole duration but can be canceled whenever. Hover can be very useful to avoid nuke rodeo deaths that cause other nuke titans to detonate by hovering way above the air and avoiding the explosions. Hover goes well with the SMR weapon. Have extreme caution when using hover on master and insane on because stalkers can one shot you mid air. 

### Low Profile

Hides jump jet trails and allows for a quieter rodeo climbing. 

Low profile has no uses in frontier defense, do not equip this. It does have very good use when in combo with cloak making you very hard to detect. 

### Titan Hunter

Titan meter earned from damaging titans is increased by 10 percent.

A must pick for waves 2-5, since most players will use titans for the majority of the game, a titan loss can be detrimental so earning titan meter is the priority. All sources of damage to titans give you more titan meter, including giving batteries and enemy rodeo will have that increase. Pick this if you are unsure of what to use.
