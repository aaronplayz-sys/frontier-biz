Loadouts allow for pilots to optimize gameplay. They are also a good way to prevent yourself from changing weapons or abilities constantly during intermission or during death respawn time. A good pilot will have specific loadouts for builds, maps and gamemodes. What will those be? That will be up to you to figure out but I will provide a template and examples below to help. 

Generally you will want two main loadouts, one for wave 1 and one for wave 2 - 5, Wave 1 loadout will consist of a anti titan and small enemy loadout usually with grenade launchers equipped. Since no titans can be called during wave 1 make sure to optimize loadout as such. 

The wave 2 - 5 loadout should be optimized for maximum damage in a short amount of time so you can get your titan fast if it is destroyed. Consider equipping weapons and abilities like phase embark, and you can equip cloak or stim to escape danger. Always select Titan hunter in Kit 2. Hover and hang can be used for very specific maps and strats (will be elaborated below). 

FYI you can change loadout names.

Some multiplayer focused loadouts are good too, like for Last titan standing, attrition or other game modes.

These are examples taken from the our discord, just know that your loadout can help you greatly with your playstyle depending on the situation.
