# Economy and Armory
{: .no_toc}

In frontier defense all pilots earn money when damaging titans, killing enemies and earn money when certain conditions are met. For this guide we will call it the economy. The economy plays a crucial role by allowing players to buy an assortment of abilities and tools from the armory. Everything is bought at the armory during each intermission.

## Money earned in combat

On the topic of earning money, In combat against titans the more damage you deal to them the more you earn money, Titan kills do not provide an extra reward so finishing off titans won’t give an additional benefit to you money wise. When it comes to the other enemies they don’t give money when damaged. These enemies are: reapers, plasma drones, cloaked drones, ticks, mortar specters, grunts and stalkers. Instead they give a bounty on whoever does the finishing blow. The more enemies you damage or kill the more money you will have.

## Money earned at wave completion

Money will be inherently earned when certain conditions are met. Upon a successful wave, each player during intermission will get a set amount of money after each wave win depending on difficulty, keep in mind that wave 5 does not count since the match ends, assuming all waves are won.

The bounties are (each x# is the total amount earned when 5 wave is completed):

|   Easy   |  Normal  |   Hard   |  Master  |  Insane  | Given to each pilot if the harvester takes no hull damage | Will be rewarded to the wave mvp | Will be rewarded to any pilot individually that didn’t die in the previous wave. |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| $700(x4) | $700(x4) | $600(x4) | $500(x4) | $400(x4) |                      $100($400)(x4)                       |             $100(x4)             |                                  $100(400)(x4)                                   |

If a player has joined later into the match they will sometimes(unclear) get a flat amount of money depending on the team's previous wins. Unless it’s wave 5 then the match ends before money can be spent.
