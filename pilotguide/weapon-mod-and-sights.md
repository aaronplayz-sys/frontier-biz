# Weapon Mod and Sights
{: .no_toc}

Weapon mods and sights are attachments that enhance your weapons. Some can change your gameplay a bit but mostly they are installed to compliment the pilots arsenal. Weapon mods only affect the weapon they are currently installed on. Only 2 mods and a sight can be installed onto a weapon.

## Weapon Mods

### Extra Ammo

Extra ammo is a mod that can be applied to any weapon, it increases the maximum amount of ammo currently in the weapons magazine and/or the amount of stored ammunition currently on the pilot. The amount is different per gun. Extra ammo mod is simple and effective for the primary and the anti titan weapons. Pretty straight forward on how it works, it's very useful for the anti titan weapons on master and insane since anti titan ammo is limited but useless on hard or below because of the infinite ammo making it have no difference. The MGL is the only gun that benefits from an increased ammo capacity and an increased magazine size.

### Gunrunner

Gunrunner mod is a mod that can be applied to any weapon other than sniper rifles and anti titan weapons. The Gunrunner mod is the bread and butter to run and gun play styles, it gives the ability of the modded weapon to hip fire while running. A good mod for shotguns and SMGs.

### Gun Ready

Gun ready gives the modded weapon a faster aim down the sights. Very useful for quick scoping and changing targets faster. On frontier defense this mod isn't really needed since there are no enemy pilots that attack you. Although good to have, there are other mods that can improve your weapons for frontier defense.

### Quick Swap

Quick swap gives the benefit of having the modded weapon pull out faster when switching to it. This is another multiplayer focused mod that doesn't really see much use in frontier defense, it can still help out when you have 2 or 3 primary weapons like the cold war or L-Star to switch between them.

### Tactikill

Pilot kills with this modded weapon will decrease your tactical cooldown. This has no use in frontier defense because there are no enemy pilots running around outside of their titains.

### Ricochet

Ricochet can be installed on the sniper rifles and the wingman elite. Bullets will bounce off of surfaces. Ricochet is a unique mod that you can install and it will make it easier to deal with targets in a closed space, also if a pilot knows how the trajectory works the pilot can get kills without looking at the target. Ricochet has no real use in frontier defense.

### Speedloader

Arguably one of the best mods for frontier defense, it can be installed onto every weapon but the charge rifle. It will increase the reload animation making every gun that better. Usually guns with slower reloads are good to install speedloader on, or weapons that run out of ammo quickly. You can put this on any gun other than the charge rifle. The anti titan weapons benefit heavily from speedloader since all of them but the MGL shoot one projectile per reload.

### Suppressor

The Suppressor can be applied to the Mozambique and the secondary pistols. This mod allows the user to be undetected on the minimap and have a quieter gun. This mod has no use on frontier defense.

### Charge Hack

Charge hack can only be applied to the charge rifle, making it charge up faster but deal less damage. This mod is very useful since the dps is much higher, if it's amped then it pretty much shreds any armored target, the only downside is that the ammo capacity never changes so you will run out of ammo and deal less damage overall.

## Sights

Sights are more of a personal preference, but some offer tactical advantages over others with aim down sights.The grenade launchers have a trajectory path crosshair in the visor.

### Factory Issue

Basic sights of the gun, for everything but snipers and the R-101 will have a non zoomed iron sight. The R-101 and the snipers have a scope by default. The grenade launchers have no sights but instead thr grenade launchers have a trajectory path crosshair in the visor.
The pistols([primary and sidearm]) have their own specific sights.

### HCOG

The HCOG slightly zooms pilots' vision in slightly, having a distance/elevation reticle on the bottom. Will show the current amount of ammo in the gun. Good sight for medium range. The weapons that have the HCOG are the assault rifles and the alternator.

### HCOG Ranger

A sight with a dot in the center. This sight is good for those who want a “clean” sight. Simple and effective. It zooms in when aiming. Decent sight for long range and medium range. The assault rifles, sub machine guns, light machine guns and the shotguns are able to have this sight installed.

### Holosight

A short range scope with a blue reticle in the middle. Simple and close range scope that can be applied to the submachine guns and shotguns. The alternator does not have it.

### AOG

Single dot in center, longer range scope that is perfect for medium and long range battles. Zooms in when scoped. The light machine guns can be installed with this sight.

### Threat Scope

All weapons that can have a scope can use this unique scope. The threat scope highlights enemies with a red color. Very useful for those who want to see through smoke and chaos. Keep in mind that this sight will take up a mod space. It has a single dot in the scope.

### Variable Zoom

A scope that only the sniper rifles have, it allows the pilot to change between 2 different magnifications, one for medium to long range and another to a very long range. Gives the snipers more variability.

## Other

### Pro Screen

A purely cosmetic attachment that counts the kills of the current gun it's installed on. All guns have this attachment unlocked after reaching g1.
