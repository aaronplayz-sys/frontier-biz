## Introduction

In TitanFall 2 Frontier defense, getting your titan after you lose it is the most crucial part of the game, as the team now has one less titan and so on, this guide will focus on mitigating by getting your titan back fast, teamwork and other methods in this guide will tell you how. When you are a pilot your most important goal is to regain your titan after a titan loss. Titan survivability itself will be explained in titan guides.

## Titan meter farm pilot build

To get your Titan back the fastest you need to deal the most amount of damage. Luckily there is a meter multiplier when you are a pilot so it shouldn’t take too long, for your pilot it is suggested using a combo or at least one of the following, buying amped weapons, A-wall, smr sidewinder, EPG, softball, satchels, Titan hunter kit, thunderbolt, archer, charge rifle with charge hack. These weapons and abilities can earn Titan meter incredibly fast with either aoe or sheer dps. As always Titan hunter is a must pick on waves 2-5.

## When to eject titan

An important skill to learn is to know when to eject your low health non-doomed titan. It is recommend doing this if your titan is half health or less. If you are playing as Monarch you will never do this as your cores are a huge investment. Knowing when to eject will require lots of game sense and prediction, some examples include, nuke titans or others that are far away from harvester, moments of spawn pauses between waves (during matches not intermission), sniper titans or other enemies that will not attack the harvester as they stay in one spot like in rise or colony.

## Sidearm and waiting strategy

If you are on the map and there are one or more remaining enemies that won't attack the harvester do not kill it, instead talk to your team and see who needs a new titan as any damaged titans should eject. Now patience will be needed since the titan meter regenerates slowly over time. If the last enemy is a reaper you can shoot from a far distance with your pistol to gain titan meter as the meter is gained per bullet shot instead of damage itself, this applies to sidearms. Keep note of any enemy that behaves this way to prevent killing them earlier on. Do not expect random or newer players to do any of this.

## Pilot Battery and Meter Farming

A final and most dangerous skill is to farm batteries off of titans. On maps like colony, wargames or rise there will be sniper titans in the distance that wont attack harvester. If you have a damaged but non doomed highlander Ronin or Monarch on you can give them batteries to recover their health, granted they aren't doomed. If you lost your titan the act of farming batteries and giving them to allies is a good way to earn your titan. Batteries give 10 core each so if all titans are healthy or doomed you can still give core to them(perfect for Monarchs). Use this for strategy as more cores means more damage. Equip cloak for the safest possible way to farm batteries without dying. It is still risky so don't be surprised if you die suddenly. If you don't have cloak equipped you can use parkour and arc grenades to increase chances of survival. If you or your team do not wish to farm batteries, you have a number of opportunities to deal damage and earn titan meter. A unique trick is that a pilot can time a battery pull and a friendly titan termination on the same Titan for extra core and battery, if the ally titan player is a Monarch they can get another battery if energy thief is selected.

A skillful pilot can time a titanfall with a battery pull to kill the enemy Titan, this is easiest on mortar titans and equipping warp fall.

## Auto Titan

For the pilots who farm batteries you must put your auto titan on guard mode and away from enemies. Do this by moving your titan somewhere behind a building or wall so it doesn't prevent it from shooting at enemies. Press V after exiting titan to command it to go into guard mode, to know if it's in guard mode your titan A.I will say “guard mode activated” and a visual symbol of a shield will be on the bottom right. A good pilot can regain a titan in less than 60 seconds in most cases.
