# Ordnance
{: .no_toc}

Ordinances are 1 use weapons that pilots throw for various effects. Ordinances are able to turn the tide of any battle so each pilot should learn to use them. Once an ordinance is thrown it will have a cooldown before it can be thrown again. Your own ordnance damage and effects will affect you so make sure to use distance when using them.

The 6 ordnances are:

## Frag Grenade

 A cookable explosive.

Frag grenades are the default ordnance that pilots will unlock upon starting a new profile or regenerating. The frag grenade has some uses in that it will do serious damage towards groups of enemies. Frag grenades don’t have utility but they can do some damage to titans and reapers. Learn to cook the frags and throw in time for instant kills. Be warned though that cooking for too long causes you to detonate yourself causing death. Frag grenade is a stable ordinance however there are better options to use than this ordnance so keep that in mind.

## Arc Grenade

After a short delay it will stun all enemies while visually blinding them.

Arc grenades have a lot of utility to offer that the game does not tell you. Arc grenades not only stun enemies but they overload mortar specter and grunt shields. The stun it provides can stop titans instantly, arc grenades are useful for stopping running nuke titans, reapers and other dangerous enemies like stalkers. A fantastic ordnance to have as it provides the whole team with way more chances to add more dps to titans. This is the perfect ordnance for new players and experienced ones. Arc grenades have a huge AOE radius so it will be very strong against clumps of enemies. Stun effects will affect you if too close to detonation.

## Fire Star

Thermite ninja star

Firestar is an accurate fast throwing projectile that erupts into thermite wherever it hits. With little AOE pilots must aim when using Firestar. Firestar and thermite will kill whatever it hits and will prevent stalkers self destruction. The firestar won't kill high health reapers and titans so it is a good counter for stalkers and such, aim for the exits of drop pods for maximum efficiency. For titans hitting a WPV and cockpits can cause a lot of damage to the titan and blind it. In summary the firestar is a good ordnance for any map or build. What it lacks in AOE it makes up for in concentrated damage allowing you to instantly kill ticks and other small enemies in less than a second. 

## Gravity Star

Pulls in enemies and projectiles before exploding.

The gravity star is a highly accurate ninja star like the Firestar that will erupt a singularity that pulls all projectiles and small enemies into it. This is perfect for any ground fight involving tons of enemies. The gravity star will pull ally and enemy projectiles into it as well so keep that in mind. The gravity star can save the harvester from ticks and running stalkers. The only weakness of the Gravity star is that it does little to nothing against titans and reapers. Gravity star doesn't do much damage to stalkers so make sure to kill them while they are suspended. Overall gravity star is a decent choice to use but is out damaged by other ordinances. Gravity star pairs well with AOE weapons. When firing inside a gravity star singularity you will notice that your bullets and Projectiles bend, if you ever wonder why you aren’t hitting your target inside the singularity it is because the singularity is bending your bullet above your target. Therefore you should aim at their feet so the bullet angles up making you hit your target. This is also affected by how high you are, EPG and thunderbolt projectiles can be manipulated in the air with gravity Star. It is recommended that you test on a private server on how the singularity manipulates objects. 

## Electric Smoke Grenade

Carpets an area with electric smoke once detonated.

The Electric Smoke Grenade does its job fast and well. With a pretty big radius that can kill small enemies very fast including stalkers. This is a good choice for those who don't like satchels. It can do damage to titans though it is not much. It will do friendly fire to yourself. The smoke grenade has a fast cooldown and with the ordnance expert kit it will even have a shorter cooldown allowing you to throw them more. This is a perfect ordinance against groups of enemies for frontier defense. Stalkers will not self-destruct when killed by smoke grenades.

## Satchel

Two remotely controlled satchels that detonate

The most damaging ordnance in titan fall 2, this is the first pick for master and insane difficulties as it will kill all small enemies but will 2 shot stalkers and reapers. It will stick to titans and will deal 1 block of damage if a titan is close to the explosion radius. Satchels can deal damage to clumps of titans and reapers making it one of the few weapons to give you a 0 - 100 core in less than a second in some cases. With the ordnance expert kit the value of satchels increases by a huge amount but only if the pilot uses them wherever they are off cooldown. Satchels will only detonate once they land on a surface or Titan/reaper. Satchels do require some game sense and skill. Timing enemies to run into the satchel will be something to work on. Also memorizing where the satchels you placed on the map and detonating them when the minimap shows enemies over the area you armed will be a skill you learn later on. Only two satchels can be placed on the map at a time, the oldest satchel will detonate if you throw a new one and so on. Never place satchels directly under a titanfall as it will detonate the satchels without damaging the titan, you can however do this with reaper warp falls. A hidden benefit is if you throw satchels behind an A-Wall it will increase its damage to two bars of health instead of one per satchel. Over time you will learn how to throw satchels and have them detonate without even looking once you get good enough.

Be mindful that attacks like thermite and nuke ejects will detonate your satchels. Shooting your own or enemy satchels will detonate them. Throwing satchels at titans defensive abilities such as legions gun shield and particle wall will bounce back detonating mid air possibly killing or injuring you, the shotgun blast in particular will detonate it. Lastly the satchel detonation is negated completely under water in maps like dry dock. Satchels will bounce off of particle walls and gun shields so never aim for those(i have died to this) instead have the legion or nuke titans run onto the satchels. Satchels will have a skill curve at first but once you use them enough you can pull off insane kills. This is the best master and insane ordnance. While a satchel is in mid air you can press the detonation button, in a short time it will detonate. Pressing the reload button will detonate any placed satchels.
