Titan Name: Legion

Health: 5 bars

Titan type: Ogre-Based Titan 

Legion is a heavy assault titan that specializes in bullets, his Arsenal is designed for close quarters and long range combat. 

## Arsenal

### Mode Switch

Unique to Legion is the ability to switch modes, 2 modes, the default is close range and the second is long range mode. 

### Primary weapon

Predator Cannon

Predator cannon is a mini gun that requires a wound up time before firing, and has 100 bullet capacity. Close range mode will be inaccurate at long ranges since it has bullet spread. Bullets are not hitscan for either mode. Alt fire allows the predator cannon to wind up without shooting while still applying speed debuf, while Legion’s mini gun is powering on, his movement speed is severely reduced for either mode. Long range mode makes the predator cannon zoom in when wound up, and will consume 2 bullets per fire instead of 1. Accuracy is heavily increased. Bullets will be blocked by allys if they are in the way. 

### Ordnance ability

Power Shot 

Power shot is a burst damage attack that the Legion can activate as soon as the mini gun is wound up. Before firing it will need a momentary charge up. Close range power shot is a shotgun blast that knocks back enemies, shotgun blast works differently by dealing it’s full damage as long as 1 power shot round hits a target. Long range mode powershot fires a single large bullet that does more damage to WPV just like a sniper round. Ally’s will block projectiles if in the way 

### Tactical ability

Mode Switch

Legions Arsenal can be changed into two different gun modes, short range and long range. When activated Legion presses a button on top of the gun, this requires you to not be shooting but can be done while the gun shield is deployed. Switching will take time. 

### Defensive ability

Gun shield

Legion deploys a shield that surrounds his minigun, this shield blocks wherever Legion is looking, gun shield once activated prevents Legion from running and forces him to wind up his minigun, dashes can still occur. Legion gun shield will block all projectiles and thermite progression but will not block nuke ejects, stalker and tick explosions, melee from reapers or titans, sword core, and flame core.

### Core ability 

Smart Core

Once smart core is activated the predator cannon will now lock on to any targets and hit them without aiming, power shots can be used while smart core is active but they will not seek out targets, smart core removes the need to reload for its entire duration. In close range mode Legions lock ons will have a wider radius but shorter lockon distance, if long range mode is equipped during smart core it will lock onto targets at a farther distance while having a smaller lockon radius(since you are zoomed in). All bullets will travel to the middle of enemies making the predator cannon unable to hit other areas of enemy titans. If more than 1 enemy is targeted by smart core the damage will be split up. You can reload during smart core for full ammo once it deactivates, if any bullets were fired prior to activation.

## Legion kits

### Enhanced Ammo Capacity

Predator ammo capacity increases to 140

### Sensor Array

Smart core’ duration is increased.

### Bulwark

Gun shield health is doubled.

### Light Weight Alloys

Legion moves faster when the predator cannon is spinning. 

### Hidden Compartment

Power shot now has two charges, powershot damage reduced by 15%

## How to play efficiently and effectively

Legion can dominate the battlefield in the right players hands. Legion has the highest battlefield tempo out of pretty much all titans, with his two modes he can provide damage and punish enemies in any distance of battle. Knowing when to switch modes and where to position yourself is the difference between a bad and a good Legion pilot. Always engage distant foes with long range mode and if you predict a long range battle always switch beforehand, if it’s a close range battle always use close range since that mode will deal more damage against close range enemies. When dealing with a crescent moon shaped attack consider using close range, keep in mind that long range consumes twice the amount of ammo. Legion works best when he fights in hallways, consider Legion a tanky sniper although he can tank for his teammates and be a attacker. Most of the time you should use long range mode to poke damage. Due to his mode switch and reload consuming time it is therefore crucial to time these correctly, always use cover and be aware of his ammo count when he’s not shooting. His ordinances can provide insane damage, the shotgun blast will knock back and punish any enemies that move forward this blast will also kill groups of enemies like grunts or stalkers or drones, his long range power shot will deal insane damage to his target making it like a sniper round, use that whenever you can for maximum damage, don’t forget to lead the long range power shot. Example: Use close range powershot against ronin or arc titans that come and attack you to buy you time. Legions gun shield is very durable but can make him very vulnerable if attacked from multiple sides.

Use his gun shield while switching modes or reloading to buy him time to attack again, his gun shield makes him very durable so Legion can be on the spearhead in attacks, Legion cannot run while gun shield is active so make sure not to deploy it near nuke ejects and other circumstances that require running. You can still dash so that can help you get into position. A very good Titan kit for legions is counter ready or over core, counter ready can cover legions reload and mode switch periods making it valuable, combine it with gun shield and you will get a lot of protection. To elaborate, activate retrieve smoke when you need to reload or mode switch, then once that electric smoke depletes you use another smoke or gun shield, if counter ready is selected then it will increase the time by a lot. Smart core is basically a free reload ability for Legion, always activate smart core when at least 1 Titan is in view. Smart core is very efficient at killing multiple enemies at once. If you need to focus on a single enemy make sure to keep unwanted enemies out of line of sight by looking away or purposely moving towards  objects that obstruct your view. Consider reloading before activating smart core to get additional fire time, this makes Legion able to attack for a considerable amount of time. Don’t hold onto smart core since you will need more electric smokes. If you decide to be aggressive then learning electric smoke deployment is a must or else Titan death is imminent.

## Legion Builds

All of Legion kits are actually pretty good, they do their job very well.

### Core focused build

This build will have Legion equip Overcore with sensor arrays for maximum core strength, this build focuses on keeping Legion alive, preferably being a turret in the back. 

### Damage focused build

This build will have Enhanced Ammo Capacity as his kit and have either counter ready equipped or lturbo engine for that extra mobility. The extra ammo will help with his long range battles. 

### Defensive build

Bulwark will be equipped with counter ready for maximum defenses. Good build on maps like rise or other maps with lanes. Deploy electric smoke, once that wears off activate gun shield for defense, this can buy you a ton of time and keep you alive. 

### Burst damage build 

This build will consist of hidden compartment, more burst damage allowing for more strategic and surgical attacks. If you combo with turbo engine you can poke enemies more behind cover.  This build gives the biggest benefit, pick this if unsure on what to pick. 

### Niche build

For his niche build lightweight alloys will be his least useful kit, movement speed is nice but his mobility is already slower making this kit have little difference. Can help avoid hostile titans falls 

## Strengths

Legion’s strengths are that he can put down consistent and relentless damage. He is able to deal with small enemies well with his smart core, reapers and drones will die very fast if the legion is accurate. Long range battles and elevations help legion. Legion has decent defenses and can help tank damage. All small enemies die instantly to close quarters powershot. Legion can also pushback enemy titans providing breathing room for the team and can deny nuke titans from approaching harvester further.

## Weaknesses 

Legion has a simpler Arsenal, meaning he has only two ways of dealing damage with little to no utility. Positioning and arc traps are a must or else all of legions bullets will be deflected by defensive abilities like particle wall or gun shield. Scorch and Ion titans will be troublesome, Since Legions' attacks get countered by all defensive abilities, worst case scenario he can deal no damage for long periods of time, meaning you must learn to switch targets. Legion requires more skill since positioning and knowing when to reload/change modes is necessary to not get caught off guard. Legion deals decent burst damage making him more of a damage over time Titan, meaning he needs longer battles to maximize his damage, Legion will have a hard time trading damage in close combat 1 v 1 situations with other titans due to his weaker damage output. Legions' slow mobility make him prone to being outflanked and surrounded, since his gun shield makes him much slower; you can actually take more damage from thermite and other explosions like cluster missiles.  Legion has a very big hit box making enemy attacks hit his WPV more often. 

## Team Composition 

Legion should play in the back or a off angle since he can operate as a sniper, Legion is very good at picking off targets and helping other friendly titans. Legion should focus on one lane or area so make sure your team covers your flanks and other paths. Since legion bullets and power shots can be blocked he should be in the front if needed. Players who are trying to get executions should try not to stand between the enemy and the ally Legion. Legion powershot will push back enemy titans so the team should be aware, this specifically is targeted to Ronin pilots. 
If needed, Legion can tank for the entire team and be a defense anchor if needed.

## Aegis

### Level 2

Piercing Rounds 

Predator cannon bullets and power shots pass through enemies and allies at no limit. Defensive abilities still block predator rounds.

### Level 5

Chassis Upgrade

Legion now has 6 bars of health instead of 5.

### Level 8

Executioner

Close range powershot now bypasses doomed state on enemy titans. Core gains from bypassing doomed state will not count doomed health for core meter. 

### Level 11

Redirect 

Damage taken to gun shield will now turn into chassis shields. This includes ally attacks. 

### Level 14

Shield Upgrade

Legions max chassis shields are now increased, Monarch healing abilities will require more uses to fully heal. Battery’s are unaffected. 

### Level 17

Drill Shot

Each time a long range powershot passes through any enemy it’s damage is increased, drill shot has no limit on how many enemies it passes. 

### Level 20

Dreadnaught 

Legion now will equip all of his kits. Choosing any legion kit thereafter does nothing. Doesn’t affect Titan kit. 

## How to play Legion with all aegis

### Aegis 2 Piercing Rounds

Legion can now do serious damage to lined up enemies not to mention that Legion can now fire behind his Ally’s making him easier to use. Once this aegis is unlocked aim for angles that allow you to hit multiple enemies. 

### Aegis 5 Chassis Upgrade

Much needed health upgrade, Legion needs all of the durability he can get

### Aegis 8 Executioner

One of the best aegis upgrades for Legion making him able to finish off not one but any near doomed titans that are caught in his close quarters power shot. After aegis 8 you can bypass nuke eject on nuke titans making you an effective Titan cleanup. Since you can instantly kill titans at about 1/2 block or less this will make all battles easier and shorter allowing you finish targets much faster, a much welcomed aegis. You will find yourself being much more efficient, Arc titans are easier to kill now. If timed right you can save the harvester from nuke titans. 

### Aegis 11 Redirect

This allows Legion a full set of chassis shields if Ally’s attack his gun wall, perfect to do during intermissions. Generally helps with survival more. Titans like Ronin and Northstar can generate shields for Legion very fast. 

### Aegis 14 Shield Upgrade

Simple shield upgrade that makes Legion absorb more damage. Monarch healing abilities will take more time and usage to fully heal. Battery chassis shield gain is unchanged.

### Aegis 17 Drill Shot

A incredibly powerful upgrade for Legion, long range powershot now has a lot of potential to severely weaken waves, always use long range power shot on lined up enemies, plenty of waves on maps allow that such as rise, angel city, colony and homestead. Each time the powershot passes through any enemy it will increase, not just titans. 

### Aegis 20 Dreadnought 

This aegis makes all of his builds active at the same time, straight up gets a buff to everything, at this point you should either equip counter ready or over core for more defensive and core focus, at this point legion can position behind allies, Legion can now tank better, have more ammo, move faster and have a longer core, one thing to mention is that since you get two power shots their damage will be reduced, this means that close range power shot will only bypass doom state on lower health titans than before, drill shot will also get a damage reduction, this is not as bad as it sounds since you literally get everything buffed. 

## Summary

To finalize the Legion guide, Legion is more unforgiving as other titans on the list, in order to perform and perform well you must learn how to position and mode switch when needed, you also need a lot of arc traps to counter defensive abilities. For more survival you will need to learn how to use electric smokes so you don’t die as often, always use and abuse close range powershot to push back enemies and to bypass executions. Don’t expect Legion and his smart core to instantly kill and do tons of damage fast. Legion doesn’t do that much damage in a short time but can weaken enemies for your allies, make sure to line up enemies for maximum bullet penetration. Get used to long range mode so you can damage and weaken enemies before engaging them face to face. With aegis 20 you can get multiple close range power shot kills since you get 2 cooldowns. When you master Legions skill ceiling you will be able to destroy everything in your path, have fun!
