## Introduction

This guide will cover the basics about how to stay alive on frontier defense while inside your Titan. Everyone knows that dying sucks so hopefully I can help give tips on how to prevent or reduce it. Below are tips and ideas.

## Step 1

### Identify the threats currently on battlefield and what to prioritize for survival.

Make sure to understand what type of enemies will deal more damage if they attack you, for example, a legion Titan and an arc Titan rush after you, who are you evading and attacking first? Look for speed, aoe abilities, and just sheer damage from enemies. Scorch titans deal insane amounts of damage so evasion and defensive tactics should be applied to them, of course, threats closest should be respected. 

## Step 2

### What are your cooldowns currently showing and what position are you in. What core level are you?

What abilities are on cooldown? If many abilities are on cooldown then retreating is recommended, attack from range and poke, if electric smoke is available then use it. If you have core then use that as well, a dead enemy won’t hurt you. Are you behind or on their path to harvester? Do you kiss scorch titans? If you are in the way then prepare to fight, if behind them and flanking make sure they die before running off.

## Step 3

### How much health do you have?

Are you high or low on health? If you are low on health consider either doing a suicide run for more damage or staying back while paying attention, going back to step 1. Do not go for terminations while low health.

## Step 4

Who is alive and if any have died how long till they respawn?

Watch out if you aren’t going to have help, if that’s the case then death can be imminent, knowing this can help you not be as reckless.

## Step 5 

### Preparation, have pilots made the necessary precautions and plans to ensure victory and survival?

Have arc traps been placed? If a team is newer, amped batteries can be bought, although not as viable. Have damaged Titans been ejected? Have pilots memorized what the wave will entail? 

## Step 6

### Communication
{: .no_toc}

Biggest of them all is communication, communicating if threats are coming and where, communication is key. This covers pretty much all the steps.

## Step 7

### Skill level, are you or any other pilots not confident in your skill level?
{: .no_toc}

Going back to communication, does your team know your skill levels aren’t good? Do you have the self-control to not engage in every reckless opportunity? Going back to step 4 being alive is generally better than dead most of the time. Do you always lose your Titan or have it doomed in every engagement? Do you have to eject and get a new Titan constantly? If you or another pilot are unsure make sure to communicate so the other pilots can make arrangements/change play style to suit a more humble combat approach.

Learning a new play style/Titan/kit can always cause you to die more, make sure to let your team know beforehand. Generally you will want to learn how to predict enemy attacks and movements while using dash and defensive abilities. That will take time and skill to learn. If you aren’t improving then perhaps take a different approach. Equip counter ready and get used to electric smokes for help. Use dashes as a prediction and not a reaction. 

## Insane Difficulty Notice

For insane difficulty, survivability is a must, when attempting the insane exo planet map as a example you will become a liability if you do not have efficient and long lasting titans. Each Titan guide will have specific information on their defensive abilities. Good luck pilots.
