## Introduction

Aegis levels are levels earned by frontier defense games only. Every milestone level provides a permanent buff to the current titan that was used. Aegis levels stay with the titan that was leveled forever. Aegis levels do not carry over to any other game mode other than frontier defense. All titans have the same level milestones. All titans will have the same chassis upgrade at aegis 5, the same goes for aegis 14: shield upgrade.

Frontier defense difficulties are locked behind level requirements: Only Titans with Aegis level 5 or more are needed to play on hard difficulty. Titans must have Aegis level 11 or more for master difficulty. Insane unlocks after reaching aegis 14 with a titan and only titans with 14+ levels can be selected for it. If you are in a party and the party leader searches for difficulties that are locked for you then any titan can be used regardless if they aren't leveled high enough. Once the hard, master and insane difficulties are unlocked for you, you can only use the titans that are leveled high enough any lower leveled titans will be locked, therefore one theoretically could not level any titans beyond the difficulty level requirement allowing for any titan to be used, although this wouldn't last forever since you always earn aegis merits.

## Progression

Aegis merits are the experience points exclusive to frontier defense. They allow you to progress through the aegis system, they are earned in multiple ways:

Mission completion = 1 for easy and normal, 2 for hard, 3 for master, insane is worth 4 merits

Each wave completion = 1 merit (maximum 5).

Difficulty win modifier: If completed on normal you gain 1 additional merit point (max 1) hard will give an additional 1 point (maximum 5). Master will add 2 additional points (maximum 10). Insane will add additional 3 points (maximum 15).

Unique titans = 1 merit point (if all four players pick different titans)

Retries remaining = 1 merit point for each retry not used (max 2)

Wave milestones: 1 merit earned each time the player kills 50 percent or more enemies per wave (maximum of 5 points per match). Additional 2 milestone merits can be earned if 2 retries are used, due to the used retries reducing merits it will have a 0 merit gain.

Aegis bonus: 1 merit gained per squad member if a player is using a limited-edition Frontier Defense titan Elite Warpaint. (maximum 4 points)

## Levels

Every aegis level that has a titan upgrade:

| Aegis Level Upgrade |
| :---: |
| Level 2 |
| Level 5 |
| Level 8 |
| Level 11 |
| Level 14 |
| Level 17 |
| Level 20 |

## Summary

The maximum Aegis level is 24 and earns you a unique prism banner, after that any aegis merits earned for titan don't earn anything after. If you join a match in the later waves, previous missed waves will not have any merit earnings for you.

Aegis levels that are earned during missions will allow your titan to be automatically upgraded. These upgrades will apply on the next titanfall you call. Private matches will earn you aegis points but will not level any pilot, weapon, Titan, faction and all other generation levels.
