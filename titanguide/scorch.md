Titan Name: Scorch

Health: 5 bars

Chassis type: Ogre-Based Chassis

Scorch is a fire based heavy Titan that specializes in area of effect abilities. 

## Arsenal

### Thermite

Unique to Scorch is that all of his abilities produce thermite. Thermite is a very hot stationary effect that burns anything it touches, your thermite will damage yourself but not allies. Thermite can be extinguished with electric smoke. 

### Primary Weapon

T-203 Thermite Launcher

A grenade launcher that fires a thermite grenade that leaves a little bit of thermite where it lands. Has 1 ammo capacity requiring a reload after every shot. Alt fire gives the launcher a zoom in and a trajectory path indicator.

### Ordnance Ability 

Flame Wall

Scorch Titan immediately slams his hand on the ground making an extended line of thermite. Flame wall travels to wherever scorch Titan is looking. Thermite stays for a short time. Flame wall will be blocked by objects and defensive abilities.

### Tactical Ability

Incendiary Trap

Upon activation Scorch launches a big gas canister that spews out flammable gas. Once thermite of any source, that being allies or enemies can ignite an incendiary trap. It will detonate causing a large portion of an area to have thermite for a time. Incendiary trap has 2 charges. Incendiary traps will bounce off walls and titans.

### Defensive Ability

Thermal Shield 

Scorch deploys a flame shield that destroys any projectiles that come inside including allies projectiles. Will not block nuke ejections, melee attacks and sword core, will be eaten fast by other cores. Thermal shield is not toggled. Thermal shield goes where the Scorch Titan looks. Thermal shield does damage to any enemy it touches. Thermal shield bypasses shield abilities. 

### Core

Flame Core

Scorch slams the ground producing a wave of thermite for insane burst damage that travels fast. Flame core goes where the scorch was looking. Flame core can travel over objects or float for a time, making elevated positions viable. Dash can be used while using flame core. Flame core bypasses all defensive abilities.

## Scorch Kits

### Wildfire Launcher

Thermite launcher does more direct damage and the thermite produced spreads farther and lasts longer.

### Tempered Plating

Scorch gains immunity to crits and his own thermite. 

### Inferno Shield

Thermal shield duration and damage are increased, cooldown remains the same. Does not produce thermite. 

### Fuel For Fire

Flame wall cooldown is reduced by 2 seconds. 

### Scorched Earth

Flame core leaves thermite on the ground. Thermite from flame core will not earn core meter and will self inflict damage.

## How to play efficiently and effectively

Scorch is one of the most devastating titans in the game, such a claim is proven by the fact that every single one of his abilities does aoe and does damage making him less of a utility and more of a damage focused Titan. When playing scorch on titanfall a good idea is to have counter ready for your titan kit for survival, Scorch doesn’t have to look at his enemies to damage them making him a good peaking Titan, make sure to cast his traps fast and ignite them with flame wall for area denial. Scorch excels in close quarters combat, hallways, corridors and choke points are his preferred areas for maximum thermite damage. Scorch can get his core very fast so make sure to use it as soon as you get it. His primary grenade launcher absolutely packs a punch making it a good option if long distance battles are being fought. Scorch works well when you deploy all of his thermite then retreat for cover if possible. Scorch has some of the best defenses, his thermal shield melts nearby enemies while making him pretty much immune to all incoming attacks. Since your thermite can’t be extinguished by your own electric smokes you can combo them with thermite for a damage combo that melts titans in close quarters, perfect for those dangerous arc titans, do this by laying traps in front of you then igniting them while deploying electric smoke, then run towards your target that’s next to you with thermal shield to melt their health in a few seconds.

With playtime you will be able to predict where the incendiary traps land allowing you to ignite them with thermite launcher instead of flame wall if it’s on cooldown, thermite launcher has a big hit box so hitting targets will be easier. Due to the thermal shield being so strong it can be used with nuclear ejection to get better angles for detonation. A good scorch pilot can hold a lane(s) by themselves making them a good solo Titan. The more enemies scorch damages the faster he gets his core, flame core is one of the best cores in the game, fast acting, aoe and penetrating high burst damage make it able to weaken and destroy waves of enemies. Electric smoke is a very useful tool for Scorch, being able to use abilities while not being damaged increases his survivability by a huge amount. Deploy electric smoke when you are on a corner then run back if needed, while in your own electric smoke, cast your abilities. Scorch kits are very strong and are all pretty much buffs with no downsides. 

## Scorch Builds

### Long Range

For long range build his wildfire launcher makes his thermite launcher even more powerful, core gains from wildfire will increase a ton by the big damage increase, keep in mind that it will also damage yourself more if fired close to you. Wildfire launcher is a good pick since it helps mediate Scorches' big weakness of long range combat. Recommended that you use counter ready to give him opportunities to fire. 

### Aggressive Brawler

For his aggressive brawler build you will want to equip Tempered plating, this will help him survive by making him have immunity to his own thermite. When attacking you can spread thermite on enemies then rush them with thermal shield which results in your opponents health melting in seconds, equip turbo engine for maximum movement gains. Tempered plating is also a newer player friendly kit. If you decide to use this build expect titans losses frequently.

### Defensive Focused

Since scorch is defensive inherently his defense build will be focused around Inferno shield for his kit, because this kit provides a huge increase in duration and damage it makes Scorch even harder to push up against, although this kit is good it will not make him immune to thermite making it more of a defensive kit than a offensive kit. If you decide to use Inferno shield use it with counter ready. When using electric smoke always combo with thermal shield for insane damage.

### Area denial Focused

This build is focused on unleashing thermite on the battlefield. This build will use fuel for fire, the cooldown reduction will allow Scorch to ignite incendiary traps more. This build is outshined by other kits a bit but can prove beneficial overtime. That being said 2 seconds isn’t that much of a cooldown reduction so this kit isn’t recommended compared to other kits. 

### Core Focused

For his core focused build the kits will be Overcore and Scorched earth. Scorche’s core build can help him deal much more burst damage and with scorched earth it can add up, some problems do come up though and that is once you use your core the enemies will be dead or at very low health making the extra thermite useless. In some instances it can actually work really well, like if you are soloing or facing multiple high health enemies. Scorched earth is mid tier but can really pay off when using flame core right next to enemies. The recommended kit is the wildfire launcher for an all around benefit. If you don’t know what to choose. 

### Pilot Only

Scorch is one of the best auto titans in the game, he should always be picked if you decide to do pilot only strats. Scorch auto Titan is the only Titan in the game who can core without a pilot inside, although this occurs very rarely. Tempered plating or wildfire launcher should be equipped. (For more in auto titans look at the pilot only auto Titan guide).

## Strengths

Scorch excels against big groups of enemies of any type. Nuke titans provide a lot of core for Scorch. Scorch plays better when alone so he can tempo his cores and abilities. Scorch can clean up waves of drones with thermal shield, thermal shield also destroys stalkers without them self destructing. Close quarters combat and tight areas are where Scorch shines the most. Scorch is one of few titans that can kill a group of arc titans fast. Thermite launcher can kill groups of ground enemies. 

## Weaknesses

Scorch doesn’t do well on open maps and distant battles. Due to Scorches slow speed it takes him longer to rotate around. Scorch can be countered by evasive maneuvers that are exacerbated in open maps. Scorch doesn’t have too many weaknesses but his long distance combat is near useless hence why hellfire launcher is such a good kit for him. 

## Team Composition

Scorch needs space to throw his thermite so scorch needs to be up front. Scorch titans do not work well with a Tone or Legion if they are behind him since Scorche’s thermal shield will destroy their projectiles. Therefore Scorch should hold a lane by himself with support from above if needed, not directly behind. Scorch can be left alone allowing the other 3 titans to focus efforts elsewhere.

## Aegis

## How to play Scorch with aegis

### Aegis 2 Double Threat

Giving the thermite launcher a second shot basically gives scorch a 100 percent increase in damage for his thermite launcher. If you equip wildfire launcher you gain even a bigger benefit. A very good aegis to have.

### Aegis 5 Chassis Shield

A much needed upgrade to Scorches health, now he can take even more punishment making him the highest health Titan other than a leveled monarch.

### Aegis 8 Hot Streak

Now the power of scorch is coming with this aegis, core meter multiplier will make him gain even more core, therefore making scorch a very good solo Titan, the more damage he does the stronger he gets, with this aegis it will make his core build much more viable. 

### Aegis 11 Roaring Flames

This and with his level 8 upgrade he will now get even more core because now all thermite sources gain a damage boost, this includes the wildefire thermite launcher making everything even stronger, this aegis gives scorch exponential gains in damage. 

### Aegis 14 Shield Upgrade

A simple aegis with no downsides, Scorches shields are stronger making him more durable giving him the chance to deal more damage.

### Aegis 17 Triple Threat

Triple threat makes wildfire launcher even more powerful, now ranged battles will be easier for scorch, this also allows him to clear reapers and smaller enemies easier from a distance. 

### Aegis 20 Explosive Barrels

Scorches finals aegis gives his incendiary traps a little damage boost, making him earn core even faster, at this point Scorch becomes a destroyer of waves, all aegis give him buffs on top of all of his abilities making him one of the best titans in frontier defense. At this point flame cores come every few seconds if enough enemies even exist at that moment. On a final note, wildfire launcher is hands down the best kit for Scorch giving him so much more damage on top of what he gains from aegis. 

## Summary

To finalize the Scorch guide, he is a pretty simple Titan, just throw your thermite and hide in electric smoke to prevent damage, if you do it correctly you can survive an entire match without even getting scratched. As Scorch you can hold a lane by yourself making you a defense anchor for your entire team. If any enemies get close you use thermal shield to melt anything, in fact a thermal shield can melt multiple titans at once. Scorch gets his value from doing damage as it allows him to do more cores. Scorch needs to be in the front of each battle to ensure victory. Lastly his best kit is counter ready for survivability and damage. 

To conclude if you couldn’t find what specific information you are looking for it is suggested looking at the other guides on frontier biz. Time to get roasting.
