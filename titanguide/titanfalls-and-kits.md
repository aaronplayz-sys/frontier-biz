# Titanfalls and Their Kits

## Introduction

A very important mechanic in Titanfall 2 is the Titanfalls, all titans and reapers deploy on the battlefield via Titanfall. All enemy and ally pilots can call in Titans. As for pilots, there are two kits for calling in your titan: Dome Shield and Warpfall. All Titanfalls will either deal huge damage or destroy targets instantly bypassing Doom State.

All reaper units will deploy on the battlefield via Warpfall making their spawn locations dangerous as there is less time to react with little visual representation since they “teleport”. On multiplayer reaper titanfalls are visually marked on the terrain but on frontier defense they are unmarked, make sure to keep this in mind if you are on or near reaper spawns. All enemy titans on frontier defense use dome shields for their kit.

Ally Titanfalls do not damage but will block you. If a titan is under an enemy Titanfall the titan AI will warn promptly.

## Dome Sheild

Dome Shield is the default Titanfall kit on every Titan loadout unless changed. After a short time, the titan will land on the battlefield surrounded by a dome shield, any enemy's inside the dome shield will be damaged over time. Dome Shield will protect the titan for its duration which lasts a good amount of time. During the dome shield duration, the titan inside will not activate until the dome is depleted. Dome Shield will instantly deplete if the piloted titan moves or uses an ability. Since the titan inside the dome shield blocks titans and blocks enemy and ally projectiles. It can be used to block choke points and provide cover for allies or enemies therefore making it useful, dome shield can be very useful against nuke titans and such for the reasons stated above. Nuke eject will not kill a dome shield titan unless the dome titan moves. Dome Shield essentially buys you a ton of time to get to your titan and kill nuke titans with the con of having it deploy much slower than a Warpfall. Be mindful of where you put Dome Shield Titanfall down since it can hinder an ally's movement and attacks, possibly throwing the game. Dome Shield is the recommended Titanfall kit due to the many listed uses.

## Warpfall

Warpfall kit allows pilots to deploy their titan much faster than the dome shield would at a fraction of the time; it can increase your chances of getting Titanfall kills. Combining warp fall with phase embark allows you to deploy and enter your titan much quicker. Warpfall has no dome shield making your titan vulnerable to damage regardless of whether you enter it or not. After deploying the Titan AI will engage in combat after a few seconds if unoccupied. Warpfall has less utility and requires more skill to prevent titan death so deploy it in safe areas.

## Verdict

It's up to you to decide which kit to use, if you want a safer option then go with the dome shield. If you are doing a specific Titanfall kill strat or build then Warpfall can work to your favour.
