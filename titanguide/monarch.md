Titan Name: Monarch 

Health: 4 bars

Titan type: Atlas-Based Titan

Monarch is a medium Titan that specializes in procuring many different upgrades on the battlefield for a wide variety of uses. 

## Arsenal

### Primary weapon

XO-16 

XO-16 is an automatic hitscan gun that has a 40 round magazine, and becomes more inaccurate the longer you fire. Alt fire is zoom. Does not penetrate targets. 

### Ordnance ability

Rocket Salvo

Once activated, the Monarch launches rockets where the cursor is aiming, rockets travel in a straight path while spiraling. Rockets have a small aoe and will do extra damage to shield abilities like particle wall.

### ability

Rearm

Once activated rearm will reset all cooldowns on dash, energy siphon and rocket salvo. Takes a few seconds before activating. Will not activate unless a cooldown is current. During the activation process you cannot use abilities or fire XO 16. 

### Defensive ability

Energy Siphon 

Precise hit scan ability that gives the Monarch some chassis shields on a successful hit. Does very little damage to health but will deal heavy damage to enemy chassis shields. Applies a quick movement and looking stun on affected foes. Will be blocked by defensive abilities. Does not heal allies. Can apply effects and shield gains onto smaller enemies like pilots and drones.

### Core ability

#### Upgrade Core

Upgrade core gives Monarch a permanent upgrade to any system the pilot chose prior to Titan fall. Maximum of 3 upgrades can be chosen and applied on the battlefield. Upgrade core will always give Monarch full chassis shields. After the third upgrade is achieved it will only give chassis shields from then on. There are 3 upgrade choices for each upgrade core level.

##### Upgrade core 1

Arc Rounds 

Arc rounds increase XO-16 ammo capacity to 50 instead of 40, damage is increased and defensive abilities like particle wall and vortex shield will be drained much more than normal upon being shot at. Applies a minor stun to enemy titans and reapers. 

Missile Racks

Rocket salvo fires twice the amount of rockets. A little more firing time is added to compensate for extra missiles. 

Energy Transfer 

Energy Siphon now applies chassis shields to friendly titans if hit, and does not earn self chassis shields if healing ally. 

##### Upgrade Core level 2

Rearm And Reload

Rearm activation is now near instant, reload speed for XO-16 is increased. 

Maelstrom

Electric smoke now deals triple the damage to enemies. 

Energy Field

Energy Siphon applies area of effect where it hits, hitting walls or ground will not remove its effects. Multiple enemies can be hit with each separate enemy giving combined chassis shields gains to the Monarch. This can stack with energy transfer giving Monarch aoe healing. 

##### Upgrade Core level 3

Multi-Target Missile System

Rocket Salvo upgrades into an ability that deals more damage and lock-ons to targets, rockets can still shoot out normally at a slightly faster speed when the ordnance button is tapped, but if the ordnance button is held they will charge and lockon to reapers and titans in view. If no enemies are in view when locking on only 1 rocket will fire upon releasing ordnance button, to fire all rockets quickly press the ordnance button once. Lockons will disappear fast if out of sight. XO-16 and energy siphon cannot be used while in lock-on screen. 

Superior Chassis 

Monarch gains a maximum of 6 blocks of health and removes weak point vulnerabilities. If doomed and superior chassis is selected it will not get Monarch out of doom state. If not doomed the monarch gets 2 blocks of health. 

XO-16 Accelerator

XO-16 will now have an accelerator mod while dealing more damage. XO-16 will shoot slow then fire rate ramps up dramatically. Stacks with arc rounds combining both buffs. 

## Monarch kits

### Shield Amplifier

Monarch’s shield gains from energy transfer are increased. Does not apply to energy transfer ally heals. 

### Energy Thief

Monarch gains a small core meter bonus and terminations will now steal a battery from enemy Titans. Energy thief will add 10 core meter to a termination and will give full chassis shields and any health if damaged previously. If an enemy Titan is rodeoed before Monarch does a termination you can get 2 battery’s off of one Titan.

### Survival Of The Fittest

Normal batteries can now repair Monarch out of doomed state. Amped batteries will give 2 blocks of health when getting out of a doomed state instead of one block. 

### Rapid Rearm

Rearms cooldown is reduced by 5 seconds, a 33 percent decrease. 

## How to play efficiently and effectively

Monarch is the most unique Titan in the game, she has the most builds and variance in play styles and roles on the battlefield. Monarch is actually a pretty weak Titan but can get a few very powerful upgrades that make her insanely strong. Monarch needs a very skilled pilot in order to play well. More will be emphasized in the builds but Monarch players should use cover to avoid damage by all means, your main goal is to stay alive and get core upgrade level 3. Don’t take any unnecessary risks. For her Arsenal her XO-16 does decent damage at first but can be upgraded to do much more. Since it is a hitscan weapon you can hit targets pretty easily. Burst fire and tap fire for small enemies so you don’t become inaccurate. Make sure to aim around defensive abilities like gun shields. For her rocket salvo it can do pretty good aoe against small targets like stalkers for instant death. It will not follow targets so you must compensate, aim at the feet if need be. Use rocket salvo against shields to deplete them fast or when you run out of ammo and need to dish out more damage. Her energy siphon serves two purposes, to stun and gain shields to help tank damage. Energy siphon should always be used to get full chassis shields so the Monarch doesn’t get WPV damage. Since energy siphon stuns targets it can be used against rushing enemies to buy you and your team some time. Energy siphon will help you stay alive.

Rearm is a very useful ability that allows the Monarch to spam abilities giving her more opportunities for damage and utility. Try to use her dashes right before using rearm to basically give her 2 or 4 dashes(if turbo engine is equipped), giving a powerful speed boost. You can also use rearm to spam energy transfer or rocket salvo twice in quick succession. Rearm is a very valuable tool for Monarch so learn how and when to use it. Monarch’s upgrade core is the centerpiece around her entire build. Always activate upgrade core once you earn 100 meter so you can get to level 3 as fast as possible. Once you are past level 3 then upgrade core just becomes a chassis shield regeneration, very useful to time with attacks or to counter damage. Just remember that you need to get as many electric smokes as you can. Speaking of, counter ready is the go too Titan kit for Monarch as Monarch needs the protection and extra damage output. Never equip nuke eject, enhanced auto Titan or stealth auto eject as those serve no purpose to what Monarch is. 

## Monarch Builds

### Gunner/roamer/duelist Build

This build focuses on XO-16 with mobility. Therefore this build is a roamer aggressive build with the option to be more defensive. Equip turbo engine, energy thief, arc rounds, rearm and reload and Xo-16 accelerator. This build makes Monarch very quick and agile making it much easier to get terminations, the fully upgraded XO-16 will deal a lot of damage while punishing defensive abilities making you very strong, hunt mortar titans and do 1v1s with this gunner build. The only weakness is that you lack area of effect like maelstrom so don’t equip this build on maps like rise as it isn’t as viable. 

### Maelstrom/Ambusher/Area Denial Build 

Maelstrom build has monarch equip energy thief, arc rounds, maelstrom, XO-16 accelerator and counter ready for the Titan kit. This build is the most damage focused, the best build to carry and deal huge aoe. Maelstrom build makes Monarch act like an ambusher/Scorch Titan. With maelstrom make sure to get as many titans near you as possible, combine maelstrom damage with XO-16 for insane dps, when leveling stay back and fire from a range. Since you have energy thief always try to steal a battery if a situation presents itself. Be warned you can be severely punished for trying to get terminations and possibly lose or doom your Titan, make sure to spam the core button if a ton of titans get hit with maelstrom as you need to keep stacking electric smokes, always use counter ready with maelstrom, no exceptions. This build is fantastic for maps like rise, colony, homestead, angle city and pretty much all, open maps like forward base Kodai actually don’t need maelstrom that much making other builds more viable in that scenario. Pick maelstrom build if in doubt.

### Healer/support Build 

Healer/support Monarch will equip rapid rearm, energy transfer, energy field(communication needed but works very well) or rearm and reload for faster rearm times that adds up over time(good for healing a single Titan or titans that distance themselves apart). 3rd upgrade is your choice, XO-16 Accelrator or superior chassis for Titan kit equip counter ready.  Always use energy siphon as healing is slow. Rearm when energy siphon cooldown is active then attack when not healing. Electric smoke team so they get protected. Stay behind the team and heal as much as possible, do not die. This build is not as viable and should be used as a privilege.

### Missile/Defensive/Agressive Build

This build will have the monarch equip rapid rearm, missile racks, rearm and reload and multi-target missile system. For the Titan kit turbo engine will be used for more mobility but counter ready works as well. This build is more of a Tone build therefore Monarch should play in the back to deal the most damage. Make sure to expend rockets whenever available to get the most value out of them, rearm when rockets are on cooldown and you will gets very good tempo of rockets. Not as strong as the gunner or maelstrom build but still can out in work, it has some aoe so use accordingly, open maps are preferred with missile build. 

### Niche Build

Monarch’s niche build consists of shield amplifier and basically any combination of upgrade cores that are different from the rest of the builds that were listed above. Possibly some combinations are better than others but will need to be proven. Survival of the fittest only has value in maps where mass battery farming can happen, and it saves 400$ if the Monarch is doomed and repaired to full health. Shield amplifier will only benefit the monarch itself and not ally shield gains rendering it pretty much useless.

## Strength

Monarch doesn’t have too many strengths compared to other titans, but she can sustain and be the most durable out of any Titan if used right. Monarch has the most variability on builds making her useful on every single map. If maelstrom is equipped, the Monarch can feed herself more electric smoke, making a train of Titan meter effectively making her not run out of core. Once core level 3 is obtained she then becomes very powerful. Monarch is very good at pest control. Having her focus on drones and other small enemies is a good option. Her strengths basically are earned through her upgrade core. 

## Weaknesses 

Monarch has the most weaknesses in the game making her a liability unless in good hands, her damage output is minimal, her core doesn’t do any damage. Her rocket salvo and energy siphon do little damage compared to other ordinances, simply Monarch will most likely die in most fights unless guerilla tactics are applied and teammate support is used. Monarch will all lose upgrades if the wave is lost or Titan death making winning matches more crucial causing her to be more liable. Monarch is very weak before she obtains her cores making the beginning game more challenging. If Monarch dies then all progress will be halted requiring the pilot to regain them all. Only two builds, gunner and maelstrom provide the most damage. Electric smoke is a necessity with Monarch or else you will fail. Monarch will have to focus on one reaper at a time making her inefficient with mass reaper waves. Monarch lacks good aoe until maelstrom has been acquired making her unable to deal with multiple titans before core level 2 very well. To emphasize on energy thief, do not throw away Titan health to get a battery, it is not worth it and will cause you to possibly die. For energy thief, Scorch titans and arc titans are the most dangerous so avoid terminating them or else you will lose health fast. 

## Team Composition 

Monarch is the Titan that requires the most help from the team, since Monarch has many different kits and upgrades the actions of the team should adjust accordingly, Monarch players should tell the team what build and play style they will be doing as Monarch, if energy thief is equipped then perhaps a Ronin won’t be a good option since they both require kills for their mechanics. Monarch should take off angles on maps and avoid the brunt force if possible. If Monarch is going support build then have your team know so you can heal them, especially if you have energy field equipped so multiple titans can be healed. Since Monarch is weaker during early game have her deal with weaker threats or off angles to fight mortar titans to feed her. If there is a drone wave Monarch should focus on them. Have allies leave stationary enemies for the monarch to feed her Titan meter off of, or feed battery’s if she is damaged. Monarch is one of the few titans that amped batteries can be bought for since she needs the extra help. Arc traps are a must with Monarch to provide her openings for her to deal more damage to makeup for her weaker mechanics. More than 1 Monarch on a team is very risky should the harvester die. 

## Aegis

### Level 2

Energized Smoke

Monarch’s electric smoke now gives her chassis shields overtime if inside it. Shield gain speed can be stacked. 

### Level 5

Chassis Upgrade

Monarch now has 5 bars of health instead of 4. Superior chassis now gives 7 max health if acquired.

### Level 8

XO-16 Sniper Configuration

XO-16 will now have an additional toggle zoom in. Bullet spread of the XO-16 is reduced. Will stack with arc rounds and XO-16 accelerator. 

### Level 11

Energized Smoke Level 2

Monarch’s electric smokes now give shields to friendly titans. Energy transfer is not needed. Players must be inside their Titan in order to receive healing. Shield gain speed can be stacked. 

### Level 14 

Shield Upgrade

Monarch’s max chassis shields are now increased, Monarch healing abilities will require more uses to fully heal herself and any aegis 14+ allys. 

### Level 17

XO-16 Critical Hit

XO-16 now deals even more damage to weak point vulnerabilities. Stacks with arc rounds and XO-16 Accelerator.

### Level 20

Apex Titan

Monarch after titanfall will spawn with a random level 1 upgraded core, it will be a 50/50 chance of being the upgrade that isn’t selected prior to titanfall (example if arc rounds is selected then either energy transfer or missile racks will randomly be picked). Apex Titan doesn’t affect normal core progression. 

## How to play Monarch with all aegis

### Aegis 2 Energized Smoke

To emphasize even more on why counter ready  and maelstrom are very good with Monarch, you get additional smoke with this aegis benefit. Now Monarch can heal herself, damage and go invisible when casting electric smoke on enemies. Can also be used to prevent death in emergency situations. Very good upgrade. Maelstrom will not increase shield health gains. Arc titans are easier to deal with, smoke yourself and fire at them to mediate any arc Titan damage. 

### Aegis 5 Chassis Upgrade

A much needed upgrade, Monarch needs all the health she can get. 

### Aegis 8 XO-16 Sniper Configuration 

This aegis makes a big difference when shooting smaller enemies, now Monarch can act as a pseudo sniper. The extra aim can make long distance battles much better. Further making XO-16 builds much stronger. 

### Aegis 11 Energized Smoke Level 2

Now Monarch can act much better as a support, allowing her to heal in a wide radius and make allys invisible; this can help your team out considerably. Communication will be needed. Remember that pilots must be inside their Titan to receive this benefit. Maelstrom will not increase chassis shield health gains. 

### Aegis 14 Shield Upgrade

A much needed upgrade, any amount of durability will help Monarch considerably. 

### Aegis 17 XO-16 Critical Hit

A very good upgrade, further emphasizing that you need to hit weak point vulnerabilities for maximum damage potential. This benefits all XO-16 builds and will stack with arc rounds and XO-16 accelerator. 

### Aegis 20 Apex Titan

A nice little upgrade, can really help you out if you get arc rounds or missile racks with different builds. Do not rely on this as it is random chance. 
By this point Monarch becomes a very powerful Titan, XO-16, Maelstrom and support build become much better. Now early game isn’t as punishing as you do more damage with more utility.

## Summary

To finalize the Monarch guide, Monarch is a punishing and rewarding Titan for those who wish to have a challenge just to score even with other friendly non Monarch titans. Monarch can be a incredible asset as she contains the most unique upgrades and kits in the game making her very versatile. After the aegis upgrades the missile build loses its value since all aegis focus on support, XO-16 and electric smoke making the respective upgrades and kits a must for master and insane. Remember to not sacrifice a ton of health for a single battery when using energy thief.  As Monarch it is your responsibility to not lose your Titan, furthermore do not eject unless absolutely necessary. Do not become a liability or else mission failure is possible. Maelstrom is Monarch’s only saving grace for the insane aoe. Always aim for WPV. Monarch’s skill ceiling is very high, so make sure to have a good team when learning her. Spam abilities and always get those chassis shields. A good combo in 1 v 1 battles like with mortar titans is to shoot rocket salvo, get close then aim and hit WPV with XO-16 while electric smoking, then very shortly after a few seconds you can melee them for a termination, very useful if energy thief is equipped. Monarch will teach you how useful electric smoke is, do not sleep on it. Have fun with the hardest Titan to learn and master in the game.
