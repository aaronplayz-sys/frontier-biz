## Introduction

Titan kits are all of the kits you can apply to all of the 7 playable titans. Titan kits can apply passive buffs or add additional abilities. This guide will explain what to choose, how to use, and how to counter each kit.

## Assault Chip

The assault chip enhances your Titan AI by making them use all of the abilities they wouldn’t normally use while being more aggressive, this kit is perfect for pilots who do not wish to enter their Titan but still want the Titan support. If you plan to do pilot only this kit is a must. Since this kit only buffs a non-piloted Titan, always pick a different kit if you plan to pilot your Titan. (The worst auto titans are Legion and Monarch)

## Stealth Auto Ejection

SAE works exactly as intended, as soon as you are doomed while piloting your Titan your Titan will automatically eject you after applying the cloak, regardless if the cloak tactical was chosen or not. This kit prevents pilot death but comes with some cons. The cons are that it removes the choice of when you want to eject which can severely impact a battle during a frontier defense match. Another downside is that this inherently only benefits you if you are losing or being reckless instead of giving an advantage while healthy. SAE is not a recommended kit to equip since there are other more useful kits to apply.

## Turbo Engine

Turbo engine reduces scorch and Legions dash cooldown and adds an extra dash to Ion, ronin, North Star, Monarch, and Tone. Perfect for higher mobility/aggressive plays. Turbo engine shines on North Star and Ronin giving them 3 dashes, Monarch effectively gains 4 dashes if rearm is used. High mobility gives a huge range of benefits like dodging or easier executions and better sword core mobility. The Turbo engine kit is a very good compliment to fast and aggressive play styles making it a very good choice for most titans and builds.

## Overcore

Overcore gives the Titan 20 percent core meter immediately after the Titanfall or after the pilot initiates a core. This also allows you to have an electric smoke ready as soon as you core or titanfall. Overcore is very useful for those who focus on core builds on titans that have a quick and fast core like Tone or Scorch. It can also benefit Ronin and Ion but not as much since their cores are longer if the kits and/or Aegis upgrades are used. Overcores' benefits add up over a long period making it more of an investment for the right titans. To make full use of Overcore make sure to expend cores asap for the benefit. Overcore is a very good choice if you are unsure of what to pick for your kit.

## Nuclear Ejection

Nuclear ejection turns your normal ejection into a massive nuclear explosion. To initiate nuclear ejection make sure you are doomed as it won’t activate if not doomed(regular ejection instead). After pressing the eject button 3 times your pilot will press some buttons and then will be thrown into the air like any other eject, below you will be your Titan exploding. Nuke eject will not give you titan meter unless enough enemies are hit or killed with it (unclear how many) but assume no meter will be gained. Your nuke eject will hurt you but will not hurt Ally’s. If you are on a map with ceilings and if you have nuke eject equipped consider equipping phase shift on your pilot to prevent your death. Nuke eject is the ultimate middle finger to your enemies and a good one at that. Not only does it penetrate but it can destroy multiple enemies and titans at once if initiated at the right time. Nuke ejection is very good on Titans like North Star, ronin, and Scorch for their defensive capabilities and speed, helping you reach areas. A nuke eject ronin build is very viable (make sure to equip a loadout for such a build as shown in the loadouts guide). Only a few abilities counter nuke ejection and that is Ronin's phase dash and his sword block if sword core is enabled. Dashes will also give pilots time to evade nuke eject. Nuke eject can’t penetrate map walls but will go through doorways so hiding behind objects is a good idea. Enemy Nuke eject warnings must be respected or else death is imminent. As good as Nuke Eject is, it is mid-tier due to Titans evading and Nuke Ejecting only helps pilots if they are not playing correctly therefore making Nuke Eject a newer player-friendly kit. That being said, a nuke eject can be a good clutch so use it accordingly.

## Counter Ready

Counter-ready gives you an additional electric smoke every time it’s earned. Counter-ready is one of the best kits one could put on their Titan. Counter ready is very good on scorch, legion, ion, tone, and especially monarch. Electric smoke is already very powerful but adding two is a 100 percent increase in electric smoke use. More will be elaborated on the universal Titan mechanics. Monarch especially benefits from counter-ready because electric smoke heals and deals more damage if Maelstrom is equipped. One of the best kits to equip for experienced players.
