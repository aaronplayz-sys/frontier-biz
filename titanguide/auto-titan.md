## Introduction

This guide will go into detail about the unique functions and behavior of each of the 7 Titans as an Auto Titan. Auto titans have a few restrictions, but with some hidden abilities that are only visible to someone who really pays attention. We will go into the Pros and Cons below. More information will be on the #pilot-only-auto-titan for the pilot side of things.

## Pros

1. Auto titans gain a very powerful and fully animated punch and stomp. This punch and stomp will damage enemies in a much wider radius than the typical piloted titan punch, with an added extra push on enemy titans. 

2. Auto titans cannot damage their pilot since the pilot gains immunity to all of their titans' effects, such as thermite or cluster missiles. Friendly fire can only apply when the pilot disembarks the titan around any active AOE abilities that they deployed. 

3. If the pilot equips Enhanced Assault Chip in their titan loadout, their auto titan becomes much more efficient with abilities and attacks. 

## Cons

1. Auto titans except Scorch cannot use their core ability, and all Auto titans cannot use electric smoke. 

2. Auto titans will not detect reaper warpfalls, leaving them destroyed if they are under them. 

3. Auto titans that are low on health but not even doomed on frontier defence can still be terminated by IMC Titans; this happens with a unique termination animation. 

4. Auto titans cannot perform terminations

5. Due to Auto Titans having no pilot, their aim and overall combat performance are severely hindered, even with the Assault chip equipped. 

6. Auto titans have a severely reduced Core meter gain compared to a piloted titan. 

## Titan Specific Information

Now, looking at the specific titans, certain titans perform much better than others when they are an auto titan. What will be shown below can give you an idea of who to choose for optimal performance. 

### Ion

The Ion auto titan will use all abilities in her kit, but will lack damage since the titan will burst fire the splitter rifle. The laser shot will be inaccurate due to the AI aiming with it. The only real strength the Ion auto titan has is its survivability due to Ion's using a vortex shield against incoming fire. Effectively becoming a decent meat shield. 

### Scorch

Scorch is by far the best auto titan in the game due to him using all of his abilities quickly; he will also be accurate with his thermite launcher. Equip tempered plating for his kit so he can survive longer due to the Scorch titan stepping into his own thermite occasionally. Any threat close to him will be damaged with a thermal shield, making the Scorch titan incredibly durable and damaging. Scorch will be the only good option for those who want the best pilot-only experience, since the titan can handle himself in most fights and has tools to destroy waves of enemies. 

### Northstar

The Northstar auto titan, in theory, would be a very strong auto titan due to her being able to snipe targets from a distance. Sadly, this is not the case because the auto titan Northstar is incredibly inaccurate. Due to her inherently relying on mobility and tether trap to keep distance from targets, she is a very poor choice when it comes to having an auto titan. Northstar should be a last pick for an auto titan and should only be picked to level her.

### Ronin

Ronin is the 2nd-best auto titan due to his powerful sword. Since a Ronin auto titan gets the extra melee damage, this also stacks with his broadsword melee expertise, making him deal huge amounts of damage in close-quarters combat. Ronin auto titan will also use a phase dash as a means to evade damage, making him last longer in combat. Ronin will use a leadwall on distant targets, but will often miss or be too far away from the target. Arc waves will also be used. Due to Ronin's low health pool and lower damage output, the Ronin auto titan cannot last long in combat, making him unable to sustain in long battles, making him a weaker choice over Scorch. Still, he is the 2nd best auto titan to use. 

### Tone

Tone as an auto titan can deal some serious damage, only inconsistently, since the titan doesn't always activate tracking rockets' reliability. The Tone auto titan is really only good if she is at a distance and is attacking targets. Other than that, she will not do well in any close engagements. The auto titan will use a particle wall, giving her more survivability. Tone as an auto titan doesn't do much, so don't pick her if you need to play optimally. 

### Legion

Legion, other than Monarch, is the worst titan to pick as an auto titan. Due to the combination of inaccuracy and the titan only tap firing, damage is nearly non-existent. The only benefit to having a Legion auto titan is the high health pool and gun shield. Do not use Legion as an auto titan in any scenario.

### Monarch

Monarch is hands down the worst auto titan to pick out of any of the titans, her low damage kit and her weak crowd control/defensive abilities do nothing in the hands of a auto titan, and in fact that she only gets strong from upgrade core, which auto titans cant activate thus making her the worst pick in titanfall 2 as a auto titan.
