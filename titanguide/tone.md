Titan Name: Tone 

Health: 4 bars

Titan type: Atlas-Based Titan

Tone is a mid to long range titan that supports ally’s and damages titans with a rocket and sonar based arsenal.

## Arsenal

### Lock On

Unique to Tone is the mechanic of locking onto enemy reapers and titans. Lock on can be seen through walls and objects. The effect is only seen by the Tone who is locking on. Ally Tones cannot share lock ons, Tone attacks apply lock-on and stack until 3 have been locked on. A visual warning is given to Titans who are locked on by an enemy Tone. Lock on will disappear after a short time if out of Tone’s sight 

### Primary Weapon

40mm Tracker Cannon 

40mm Tracker Cannon is a precision gun that applies 1 lock on to enemy reapers, cloaked drones and titans. Semi automatic with a fire rate cap, it is projectile based and has 12 bullets in each magazine. Will do area of effect to wherever the bullet lands, these will cause lock ons. Alt fire is a zoom in option to tighten the bullet spread. Aiming gives no additional benefit. Dash can be used while aiming. 

### Ordnance Ability

Tracking Rockets 

Once 3 lock ons have stacked onto a target a volley of rockets can be launched at the target, they will follow the target until missing or hitting. Tracking rockets has no cooldown. Once launched the Tracking rockets will remove the lockon. Activating Tracking rockets will fire on all currently locked targets regardless of where they are. Rockets can be curved around walls, roofs, through entrances and window openings depending on where the Tone looks. Rockets will be destroyed if they hit ally titans, map objects or walls. 

### Tactical Ability

Sonar Pulse

Tone launches a sonar beacon that will cover a wide circumference once landed, every enemy inside the circumference will be outlined through walls. All enemy reapers and titans inside the first pulse will be given one lock on. Sonar pulse projectiles will be blocked by physical walls, shields and titans. Once landed cannot be destroyed. 

### Defensive Ability

Particle Wall

Instantly deploys a wide and tall shield that is one way, wherever Tone looks it will face. Particle wall deflects all enemy and ally projectiles on the other side and thermite advancement but will not block nuclear eject, stalker self destruct, flame core, melee, electric smoke, ticks and cluster missiles. 

### Core Ability 

Salvo Core

Tone Titan unleashes a massive swarm of rockets that follow wherever the Tone Titan is looking, once a target is near the crosshairs the rockets will seek out that target. Rockets that have been in the air for too long self-destruct. Rockets will do a little bit of area of affect. Once rockets are unleashed the Tone Titan can gain core once again immediately although salvo core rockets will not give core. Salvo core will still launch rockets after pilot ejects. 

## Tone Kits

### Enhanced Tracker Rounds

Weak point vulnerability hits with 40mm tracker cannon give 2 tracker marks. Applies on reapers as well. 

### Reinforced Particle Wall

Duration and health increased for particle wall. 

### Pulse Echo

Sonar lock after a short time will stack another lockon. Sonar lock’s duration is increased. Some targets will only get 1 lockon if they entered the circumference later. 

### Rocket Barrage

Tracking rockets fire an additional 2 rockets. 

### Burst Loader

When aiming the 40mm tracker cannon Tone will fire a burst of 3 rounds. 

## How to play efficiently and effectively

Tone has some of the best damage output in the game, the fact that tracking rockets has no cooldown makes Tone a monster if positioned right. Tone is an interesting Titan, depending on the map she can either be inhibited or excel in combat. To properly use tone it is heavily recommended that you get familiar with her 40mm cannon projectiles, make sure to pre fire so enemies run into them as it is easy to miss shots, it is not a hit scan weapon so it needs to be aimed to compensate for bullet time. The more accurate you are with a tracker cannon the more lock ons you can achieve making you that more powerful. As for tracking rockets, these are your main source of damage so make sure to get as many lock ons as possible, do not hold onto lock ons unless for specific reason. The more you expend rockets and shoot the more better your performance will be. Some techniques for  Tracking rockets are that they can be angled to go around objects, friendly titans and buildings.

If you want to have rockets hit a target behind something on the left, aim farther to the right and activate tracking rockets and vice versa, rockets that come out of tone move out a bit before following the target, if you want to hit a close target that’s in your face, aim your cursor to their legs or feet to have rockets not go over them. If you are dealing with moving targets make sure to have your cursor follow them when launching rockets. If a friendly titan is above you then aim in the air before unleashing tracking rockets, if you are dealing with particle walls or legion gun shields then try to aim to the side or above the Titan to angle rockets around those types of shields. Tone’s sonar lock is crucial for getting mass lock ons so make sure to deploy it on groups of enemies. The more clumped up the enemies are the better for you. When engaging foes they will shoot back, thankfully particle wall can help with that, very fast and deployable particle wall can give you plenty of time to get lock ons while not getting damaged yourself, combine that with counter ready and you can shield yourself for a long time, since your own electric smokes don’t inhibit your lock ons you can use electric smokes in close quarters to help  fend off enemies.

This also allows you to shoot at a wave that’s coming your direction while “invisible”. The particle wall should be deployed as a defensive supplement. Tones Salvo core is a very strong core that can melt a single or group of targets. Due to it being able to maneuver around it can be activated before a fight can happen. Always look up to gather rockets in the sky before or during attacking, once you spot an opponent the rockets will land on their head causing huge burst damage. As Tone you don’t want to hold onto your core since you will need more electric smokes. 

## Tone Builds

### Core/damage focused build

This build will have Tone equip Overcore and Rocket barrage for the kits. This is the standard damage focused build that will allow you to destroy all lockable enemies faster, since you shoot more rockets per tracking rocket you will gain more core from the extra damage. Combo that with Overcore and this allows you to use salvo core way more often. Resulting in exponential damage output benefits. This build is recommended for all skill levels and maps. 

### Support Build

For this build echo pulse will be equipped. Titan kit doesn’t matter too much. Double counter can always work. This build focuses on Tone using sonar ping on enemies for you and your ally’s to see, additionally this will help Tone with lock ons making all enemies inside gain 2 lock ons in a short time. This build does as much damage as the damage/core build but it can help considerably on insane difficulty and with maps that are hard to get lock ons.

### Niche Builds

The rest of the Tone kits are outshined by the two above for various reasons, to start with the kit enhanced tracker rounds can be useful for efficiency but will only be viable if the Titan is accurate, additionally this provides with no damage boost or support boost of any kind. For the next kit we will cover the reinforced particle wall, this can make Tone more defensive but does not promote more damage, Finally for the burst loader kit, this kit doesn’t do much other than increase the fire rate in burst fires after charging up, it can definitely help out with more with defense but that’s it. No added benefits so the burst loader is considered niche. Any of the niche builds could prove useful if the pilot who uses it knows what they are doing. 

## Strengths

Tone can easily destroy waves of drones, reapers and other small enemies due to her tracking rockets and tracker cannon. Making her an effective pest control Titan. Tone can deal with multiple clumped up enemies at once since she can have multiple lock ons simultaneously making her dish out burst damage like crazy. Tone can solo out a target pretty well as long as the pilot gets as many lock ons as possible. Tone is very good in open maps, maps with elevations are even better. Tone is best at the back behind the team dishing out damage. Due to her sonar she can be a support for her team making enemies that couldn’t be seen visible. Particle wall can be deployed for allies if needed offering additional support.

## Weaknesses 

Tone has some major weaknesses, Tone rockets are considered top threats and will be countered by all defensive abilities. Since the only way Tone deals damage is by her rockets they become her crutch as well. If a Tone cannot get lock ons she is considered a liability. Enemy Legion types gun shields can prevent Tone from getting lock ons making arc traps a necessity. Tone has trouble with close range combat since she has no crowd control, and her particle wall can be rushed making her vulnerable to rush attacks. Particularly arc titans are a Tones worst nightmare since they have so many abilities to counter her rockets like sword block or phase dash or to arc wave her particle wall. Dash can also be used to evade Tone rockets. Maps with tight corridors and with tons of objects around the map make locking on hard, even worse is that it will prevent most of your rockets from hitting your target if they use dash to get behind cover, maps like rise, dry dock and colony are good examples where Tone will be inefficient.

## Team Composition

Tone needs some space for her tracker cannon and rockets to land, Tone players should work around and away from scorch Ally’s since the thermal shield destroys projectiles. Tone can help Ronin players get kills but the Ronin could possibly get in the way of the rockets. Tone can work well with legion and northstar since both can pick off long ranged targets with Tone. Since Tone doesn’t do well in close quarters combat, consider having a Legion of Ion take the front of the battle, give them a particle wall to help them out when retreating. Remember that the particle wall is one sided and will deploy where looking so look back when you deploy particle wall.

## How to play with all aegis

### Aegis 2 Splasher Rounds

This aegis makes getting lockons much easier on single and multiple targets. Now you can shoot beside enemy particle walls and legion gun shields to get lock ons. Due to the increased aoe, tracker cannon can deal with groups of small enemies even better making Tone one of the best pest control titans in the game. Will deal harm to self if explosion is close. Once this aegis is equipped you will get many many more lockons. 

### Aegis 5 Chassis Upgrade

Simple upgrade that increases Tone’s health to 5 instead of 4 blocks. This is very useful since Tone can be flanked giving her more time to fight.

### Aegis 8 Sonar Weak Points

This aegis is very helpful, now that enemies in sonar pulse take extra damage you can now make your team and you do 100 percent more damage if everyone is added up, this includes getting cores faster from more damage, now you and your team will be even stronger. Sonar Weak Points now makes the support build rival the core/damage build. 

### Aegis 11 40mm Extended Ammo

This will make Tones damage output skyrocket since now reloads happen less often, being able to do more consistent lockons now adds the benefit of getting more cores. Now pest control is even easier. A fantastic upgrade that enhances the Tone Titan as a whole. 

### Aegis 14 Shield Upgrade

Simple shield upgrade that makes Tone absorb more damage. Monarch healing abilities will take more time and usage to fully heal. Battery chassis shield gain is unchanged.

### Aegis 17 Signal Strength

An upgrade that benefits all Tone combat, now her support build and her damage build is even more powerful, at this point Tone can heavily damage and support very well. 

### Aegis 20 Salvo Core Barrage

To finalize this aegis gives tone double the rockets in her salvo core, a complete added benefit that will make Tone even more devastating, at this point all of your abilities are buffed, your enemies will die very fast now. Tone becomes very powerful after aegis 20. 

## Summary

To finalize the Tone guide she plays very well on certain maps, Forward Base Kodai, Exo Planet and Backwater Canal. Tone’s skill ceiling is higher than other titans so consider leveling Ion or Scorch if you are very new. Always get tons of arc traps so lockons can be achieved easier. Tone will need game sense to play well so don’t beat yourself up if she isn’t working out for you. Tone can be an incredibly powerful Titan, she works best as a turret while other titans tank damage like Legion or Scorch. Always go to higher ground. Avoid being next to other titans so tracking rockets won’t be destroyed. Accept that arc titans and Scorch titans will be very hard to kill, always bait out their defensive abilities early. Remember that the more lockons you do the more damage you do. When locked onto a target, spam the launch button for tracking rockets for the most efficient tempo and damage. Always use cores, don’t wait for the “right moment” I’d recommend equipping counter ready for survivability and generally for all builds.
