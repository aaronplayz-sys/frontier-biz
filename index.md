## Guides for Frontier Defense on TitainFall 2

Some information may be unique and while others will have the same information in more than one depending on how universal mechanic is. Rest assured that everything is covered.

There is a lot of information to cover, for those that are wiling to read... If you are new to Frontier Defense[^1] or looking to get over skill plateaus, this is the right place for you!

{: .important }
> Assume all guides are for Insane or Master Frontier Defense difficulty unless stated otherwise. We attempted to include all multiplayer mechanics.
>
> If you have additional information that is factual, join our [discord server] and create a post in guide-discussions and the guide writers will take a look. Or open an issue on [GitHub]. Be prepared to debate and defend your points, statements and opinions about guides on what should be added, edited/changed or removed. Others can join in on the discussions.
>
> On a final note, everyone has different skill sets and perspectives, two people can be right at the same time while both are wrong. Enjoy reading and get better, be respectful and have fun.
