For frontier defense there are 4 difficulties and a unique difficulty with private matches. 

## Easy
(25) - number representation of difficulty spike. 

Titan weak spot damage is increased for enemies. Doomed titan health reduced. All titans have 2 less blocks of health. All enemies have severely reduced health. Enemy A.I is handicapped. Harvester shields are very durable. 

## Normal
(50)

All titans have 1 less block of health. All enemies have reduced health. Doomed titan health higher. A.I will use more abilities and attack a bit more. Harvester durability slightly weakened. 

## Hard
(100)

Stalkers gain the use of the EPG, making them fire upon visible targets. Mortar specters gain a shield in front of them when stationed. All titans will have the standard health according to chassis (3,4,5). Better a.i that is more accurate and aggressive. Harvester shield strength is humble. Normal health for all enemies. Doomed titan health normal. 

## Master
(200)

Grunts have a shield bearer in the 4 man squad, Stalker EPG will always one shot pilots. All titans spawn with full chassis shields just like nuke titans. All enemies have Enhanced a.i that is very accurate and uses all abilities. Harvester shields are weaker. Anti titan weapons now have a set amount of reserve ammunition. All small enemies and reapers have extra health. Grunts now carry charge rifles 


## Insane 
(400) - huge increase due to needing game sense and proficiency. 

Insane removes the 2 retries allowance, meaning harvester damage is permanent and harvester death is match loss. Minimap removed. A.I has been enhanced even more. Harvester shields strength is delicate. Plasma drone and mortar titan damage increased to harvester. 

## Private match 

Core gains from doing damage or kills are heavily increased, example a reaper death will give 20 core instead of 5, and small targets like drones or grunts give 5 instead of 1. This results in private matches giving no exp but will still level aegis upgrades. 

## Insane

If you are doing insane you should get comfortable using the tab button to see what enemies are left, that with communication should make the game easier.
