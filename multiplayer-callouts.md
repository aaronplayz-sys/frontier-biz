# Multiplayer Callouts
{: .no_toc}

Below are callouts for all of the multiplayer maps in titanfall 2. This was made in mind only for PVP modes, this does not include pilot vs pilot exclusive maps or frontier defense spawns. Refer to the frontier defense map guides for that information. These callouts can be used in pvp or frontier defense although they were made in mind for the last titan standing mode in particular. These callouts will be incredibly useful where communication is a must.
